<h2 class="main">PUBLISHERS&#x2019; NOTE</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">William Lithgow was born in Lanark about 1582. The actual date of his birth is uncertain,
but he states (page 377) that he was thirty-three in 1615, and in &#x2018;The present Surveigh
of London&#x2019; &#x2018;past threescore years&#x2019; in April, 1643. He was the eldest son of James
Lithgow, Burgess of Lanark, and Alison Grahame, his wife. He was educated at Lanark
Grammar School, and, according to Sir Walter Scott,<a class="noteref" id="xd29e444src" href="#xd29e444">1</a> was &#x2018;bred a tailor.&#x2019; Scott does not, however, give his authority for this statement.
Lithgow seems to have started his travels at a very early age, having &#x2018;a large infusion
of the wandering spirit common to his country-men.&#x2019;<a class="noteref" id="xd29e448src" href="#xd29e448">2</a> He says himself that &#x2018;neither ambition, too much curiosity, nor any reputation I
ever sought did expose me to such long peregrinations and dangerous adventures past&#x2019;&#x2014;but
&#x2018;that undeserved Dalida wrong.&#x2019; What this mysterious &#x2018;Dalida wrong&#x2019; was is unknown,
but family tradition has it that the four brothers, &#x2018;foure blood-shedding wolves,&#x2019;
of a certain Miss Lockhart, finding their sister with Lithgow, set upon him and cut
off his ears, and from this arose his local nickname of &#x2018;&#x200a;&#x201c;Cutlugged&#x201d; or &#x201c;Lugless&#x201d;
Will.&#x2019; Be this as it may, by 1609, Lithgow had made &#x2018;two voyages to the Orcadian and
Zetlandian Isles, in the stripling age of mine adolescency, and there <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb.x" href="#pb.x">x</a>]</span>after surveighing all Germany, Bohemia, Helvetia, and the Low-Countreys from end to
end; I visited Paris, where I remained ten moneths.&#x2019;
</p>
<p>From Paris, on March 7th, 1609, Lithgow set out on the first of the three journeys
of which he gives an account in his &#x2018;Totall Discourse,&#x2019; where he claims that his &#x2018;paynefull
feet traced over (beside my passages of Seas and Rivers) thirty-six thousand and odde
miles, which draweth neare to twice the circumference of the whole Earth.&#x2019;
</p>
<p>It was on the third of these journeys, when passing through Spain with the intention
of seeing &#x2018;Great Prester Jehan and his Empire,&#x2019; that he was thrown into prison in
Malaga as a spy and severely tortured. He was released by the intervention of the
English Consul there and the English Ambassador at Madrid, backed by a division of
King James&#x2019; Navy which, under the command of Sir Robert Maunsell, happened opportunely
to be lying in Malaga Roads, on its return from the expedition against Algiers.
</p>
<p>On his arrival at Dartford, fifty days after leaving Malaga, Lithgow was carried to
the Court at Theobalds, and exhibited his &#x2018;martyrd anatomy&#x2019; to the whole Court, &#x2018;even
from the King to the Kitchin.&#x2019; At the King&#x2019;s expense he was sent twice to Bath, where
he recovered his health, although his left arm and crushed bones were incurable. Early
in 1622 he was sent to the Marshalsea prison for a long period<a class="noteref" id="xd29e457src" href="#xd29e457">3</a> for assaulting, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb.xi" href="#pb.xi">xi</a>]</span>in the presence chamber, the Spanish Ambassador Gondomar, whose empty promises of
redress for his sufferings at Malaga had exasperated Lithgow beyond endurance.
</p>
<p>In 1624 Lithgow preferred a Bill of Grievance to the House of Lords, which he daily
followed for seventeen weeks, but &#x2018;the house breaking up abruptly their order for
my suite could take none effect as then, nor yet since, in regard it was no Session
Parliament.&#x2019; In the spring of 1627 he left the Court for Scotland; he traversed the
Western Isles, and was &#x2018;kindly intertayned&#x2019; in Brodick Castle by James, Marquess of
Hamilton.
</p>
<p>In 1632 Lithgow published the first collected edition<a class="noteref" id="xd29e470src" href="#xd29e470">4</a> of his Travels, under the title of &#x2018;The Totall Discourse Of the Rare Aduentures and
painefull Peregrinations of long nineteene Yeares Trauayles, from Scotland, to the
most Famous Kingdomes in Europe, Asia, and Affrica.&#x2026; Imprinted at London by Nicholas
Okes.&#x2019; The publication seems to have got him immediately into trouble, probably owing
to the Spanish influence at Court, as there is a petition extant<a class="noteref" id="xd29e473src" href="#xd29e473">5</a> from him in which he states that he &#x2018;had no satisfaction for his grievous torments
sustained in Malaga, and having in the description of his foreign travels succinctly
avouched the woeful memory of such disastrous accidents, had been this long time committed
close prisoner to the Gatehouse, when he had contracted great sickness to the danger
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb.xii" href="#pb.xii">xii</a>]</span>of his life. The printer in whom only the reprehension was, is long ago &#x201c;decarcerat,&#x201d;
but he is retained in severe punishment.&#x2019; He protests that he will never &#x2018;meddle any
more with the Spaniard however his lamentable wrongs remain unrepaired.&#x2019;
</p>
<p>On the 16th May, 1637, Lithgow, mounted on a &#x2018;Gallowegian nagge,&#x2019; left Scotland, where
he had been the guest of the Earl of Galloway, intending to embark at London for Russia,
but shipping failing, and summer being over, he resolved to go instead to Breda, and
on his return published &#x2018;A True and Experimentall Discourse, upon the beginning, proceeding
and Victorious event of this last Siege of Breda &#x2026; London: Printed by J. Okes for
J. Rothwel &#x2026; 1637.&#x2019;

<p>On 24th August, 1643, Lithgow again left Scotland, embarking at Prestonpans for London,
&#x2018;In all which deserted way, betweene Forth and Gravesend, wee found onely three ships,
two Scotsmen and a Noruegian, and one of the royall whelps lying at anker in Aermouth
road, which made the sea resemble a wildernesse.&#x2019; As the result of this visit, he
published &#x2018;The present Surveigh of London and England&#x2019;s State &#x2026; London, Printed by
J.&nbsp;O. 1643.&#x2019; In this book Lithgow gives an interesting account of the fortifications
raised by the citizens for defence against the Royalist army. The last work known
to have been published by him is &#x2018;An Experimental and Exact Relation upon that famous
and renowned Siege of Newcastle &#x2026; Edinburgh, printed by Robert Bryson 1645.&#x2019; From
this date all trace of him is lost; the date of his death and the place of his burial
are unknown, though there is a tradition that he died in Lanark, and lies buried in
the churchyard of St. Kentigern there.

<p>Editions of &#x2018;The Totall Discourse&#x2019; were published in London in 1640 and 1682, and
in Edinburgh in 1770 and 1814, while a volume of the &#x2018;Poetical Remains of William
Lithgow,&#x2019; containing valuable &#x2018;Prefatory Remarks,&#x2019; was collected and published by
Dr. James Maidment in Edinburgh in 1863.
</p>
<p>The text of &#x2018;The Totall Discourse&#x2019; now published is a reprint of the <i lang="la">editio princeps</i> of 1632. References to the pages of the original edition are given in the margin.
The letters i, j, u, and v have been altered to conform to modern usage, and obvious
printers&#x2019; errors both of spelling and punctuation have been corrected. The index of
the original text has been replaced by a fuller one in this edition.

CHARLES,<br>
By the Grace of GOD, King of Great Britaine,<br>

</p>
<p>GRACIOUS SIR;
</p>
<p class="xd29e648"><span class="xd29e648init">I</span>f Loyall Duty may bee counted presumption? then doubtlesse the best of my meanest
worth must beg pardon, for clayming so Royall a Patronage: Yet to whom should I prostrate
my Pen and Pilgrimage? if not unto your Sacred Majesty: Nay, none so able to Receive
it, none so powerfull to Protect it; and none so justly to claime it, as your Soveraigne
Selfe. The Subject treateth of my tedious and curious Travailes, in the best and worst
parts of the world; which being begunne in Your hopefull Infancy, are now finally
accomplished in the fulnesse of Your thrice blessed Majority.
</p>
<p>The generall Discourse it selfe, is most fixed upon the Lawes, Religion, Manners,
Policies, and Government of Kings, Kingdomes, People, Principalities and Powers; and
therefore so much the more fit for your Majesty. The defect resting onely in me, the
worthlesse Author, in handling a rare and plentifull Subject, with a homely <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb.xviii" href="#pb.xviii">xviii</a>]</span>and familiar Stile; no wayes fit for Soveraignity to peruse.
</p>
<p>Yet (Royall Sir) vouchsafe to remember how thankefully Alexander, received a small
Cup of Water; and what a high Value was set upon the Widdowes Mite. If I have made
use of my poore Talent, the profit redoundeth unto my Country; which being shaddowed
under your auspicuous Favour, shall leave a greater stampe to the Worke, and a deeper
impression, of future knowledge, to the curious Understanders. And how often wont
your ever blessed Father, graciously to peruse Lines of mine, of far lesser note then
these be: Yea, and (viva voce) the punctuall Discourse of all my three Voyages, which
are now layd open to the Vulgar World; and therefore I dare humbly expect a greater
favour for a larger and more serious Taske.
</p>
<p>So likewise your owne Princely adventures beyond Seas, in measuring large Kingdomes,
&amp; the glassie face of the great Ocean: have invited me to lay prostrate my painefull
peregrinations, at your Sacred feete. Humbly beseeching your Regall goodnesse, to
remarke the matter and manner of this Worke; howsoever the Gift, &amp; the Giver bee deficient.
And questionlesse as the Bee, gathereth sweetest Hony out of sowrest Flowers, your
Royall understanding may finde something, to underprope the Defects of my nothing;
and my soule to exult in the smallest sparke of your Gracious Clemency. And lastly,
the grievous Sufferings, tortures, and torments, I sustayned in Malaga, being taken
as a Spye for your Late Fathers Fleete, exposed agaynst Algier: and condemned to death
by their bloody Inquisition for the Gospells sake. These (I prostrate say) doe command
me to present the perfect passage thereof, unto your Royall &amp; Religious consideration.
Sufficient Certificates, and infallible approbations are annexed to the Tragicall
discourse it selfe; and it also humbly bequeathing all, unto your Princely piety and
pitty, to Commiserate both my case and cause. Wherefore (and as duty bindeth) I shall
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb.xix" href="#pb.xix">xix</a>]</span>ever beseech God to preserve your Royall Raigne from wicked Achitophells, to guard
your Sacred person with Heavenly Angels, and to guide your Monarchicke State, with
faithful and Religious Counsellours.

<h2 class="main">THE PROLOGUE TO THE READER</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="xd29e673"><span class="xd29e673init">J</span>udicious Lector; if good Bookes may be tearmed wise guides, then certainely true Histories,
may be tearmed perfite Oracles, secret Counsellours, private Schoolemasters, familiar
friends to cherish knowledge, and the best Intelligencers, for all intendements; being
duely pondered, and rightly used. This laborious worke then of mine, depending on
this preamble, is onely composed of mine owne eye sight, and occular experience; (pluris
est occulatus testis unus, quam auriti decem) being the perfit mirrour, and lively
Portraicture of true understanding, excelling far all inventions whatsoever, Poeticque,
or Theoricque. And now to shun Ingratitude, which I disdaine as Hell, I thought it
best to exhibit the profit of my paynefull travailes to the desirous world; for two
respects, the one a naturall obligation, the other a generall request: for as my dangerous
adventures, have bene wrought out from the infinit variety of variable sights, innumerable
toyles, pleasures, and inevitable sorrowes; so doth it also best simpathize with reason,
and most fitting, that I should generally dispose of the same, to the temperate judgements
of the better sort, the sound and absolute opinions of the Judicious; and to the variable
censures of calumnious Critticks, who run at random, in the fields of other mens labours,
but can not find the home-bred way in their owne close grounds: And therefore the
different disposition of the good and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb.xxii" href="#pb.xxii">xxii</a>]</span>bad, doe best concurre with the interchangeable occurrences of the matter.
</p>
<p>Neverthelesse, for thy more easier understanding I have divided this History, in ten
severall parts, and they also in three Bookes; which being seriously perused, doubtlesse
thy labour shall receave both profit and pleasure: Accept them therefore with the
same love, that I offer them to thee, since they cost thee nothing but the reading,
how deare soever they are to mee: But understand me better, I scorne to draw my pen
to the ignorant foole, neither shall it stoop to the proud Knave, for I contemne both:
To the wise I know it will be welcome, to the profound Historian, yeeld knowledge,
contemplation, and direction, and to the understanding Gentleman, insight, instruction,
and recreation; and to the true-bred Poet fraternall love, both in meane and manner.
Now as touching the hissing of snakish Papists; a tush for that snarling Crew; for
as this worke, being fensed with experience, and garnished with trueth, is more than
able to batter downe the stinging venome of their despightfull waspishnes: so also
they may clearely see therein, as in a Mirrour, their owne blindnes, and the damnable
errours of their blind Guiders, Deceavers, and Idolaters: And above all the cruell
infliction imposed upon me, by the mercilesse Inquisition of their profession in Malaga:
which for Christs sake I constantly suffered, in tortures, tormentes, and hunger:
And lastly they may perceave Gods miraculous mercy, in discovering and delivering
me from such a concealed and inhumane murder. And now referring the well set Reader
to the History it selfe, where satisfaction lyeth ready to receave him, and expectation
desirous of deserved thanks; I come to talke with the scelerate Companion: If thou
beest a Villane, a Ruffian, a Momus, a Knave, a Carper, a Crittick, a Bubo, a Buffon,
a stupid Asse, and a gnawing worme with envious lips; I bequeath thee to a Carnificiall
reward: where a flaxing rope will soone dispatch thy snarling slander, and free my
toylsome travells, and now paynefull labours, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb.xxiii" href="#pb.xxiii">xxiii</a>]</span>from the deadly poyson of thy sharpe edged calumnies: and so go hang thy selfe, for
I neither will respect thy love, nor regard thy malice: And shall ever and alwayes
remayne;

<p class="xd29e939"><span class="xd29e939init">I</span>t was a wise saying amongst the Auncients, that thrice happy and blest was that Kingdome,
when old men bore sway and ruled the State, and young men travelled abroad: The first
by long experience prudently to execute judgement; and the latter by sight and knowledge
of forraine soyles and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2">2</a>]</span><span class="right-marginnote">[I. 2.]</span>lawes, growing more judicious; might when come to age and preferment, the more facily,
and dexteriously exhibit Justice at home. But what shall I say to these moderne and
dissolute times? when by the contrary meanes, travell is sleighted, government abused,
and insinuating Homelings, thrust in high offices, incapeable of them, being pratling
Parrots, and sounding Cymbals: who convert sound Judgement and Justice, to their owne
greedy respects, and selfe mercinary ends; turning their chiefest felicity to avaritious
ambition and vaine glory, and their sweetest fortunes, to their belly and their backe.
O miserable and effeminate age! when vertue by most men is despised, and neglected,
and sensuall vice every where exalted: Nay; ruffian Pandors, by hopefull youth and
prodigall gallants, are now clothed, Coatched, and richly rewarded; whilst best merits
and highest deserts, of rarest spirits, are neither looked to, set by, nor regarded.
And for approbation, and examples sake, of their valerous designes, let them thinke
upon latter passages, nor worthy to be thought upon, and they will finde this future
caveat to stand needfull, Hæc olim meminisse juvabit. So likewise now every Capri-cullion
from Cæsar, to the Pascorell, can crowd and chawe from his warbling waspishnes, this
stinging censure of absurd untrueth, that Travellers and Poets may lye &amp; lye by authority,
which they themselves performe at home without leave.

as to the World, a mungrell to both; may have a lawfull (unlawfull) liberty assigned.
Any marvell? if men in this kind be so injuriously censured, when the very Gospell
it selfe, by perfidious Atheists, Formalists, Sophisters, Romish-rabines, Nullifidians,
and Schismaticall Sectaries, is quartered, mangled, and rejected; such be the Satanicall
<span class="right-marginnote">[I. 3.]</span>opinions of this hell-borne age: Whose confused conceits, blasphemies, incredulities,
and imaginary devisions, have shamefully stained the better part of this now best
World. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3">3</a>]</span>Nay, good and godly Kings, so pricked at, and wounded by the viperous murmurings of
miscreant villaines, as though their royall and just lives were the meere inordinate
paternes of all impiety, and lewdnesse. Sith therefore the Sacred Scriptures, the
gods of the earth, Ecclesiasticke columes; yea the name and fame of the most righteous
alive, be thus diversly taxed, and vituperiously calumniated; can prevention in me,
escape the lawlesse horrour of this impoysoned fury? No, I have had already the assault,
and newly prepared, patience proofe to receive more, wrought by the piercinghammer,
of nineteene winters, as many Summers deare bought toyle. Let venome-thundring Crittickes,
contumeliously carpe, infernall firebrand Cerberans barke, and the hell prepared off
scourings of true religion gnashing grudge I have aheart can smile, at their backbiting
malice, a judgement to discerne such wormish waspes, and if present, the weight of
understanding truth, to confound their blind absurdities with reason. As for chamber

age, wherein so many Simonaicall Matchevilians, mercenary parasits, and arch-betraying
Sicophants live, vindicating themselves excessively, upon the advantage of time, I
insufficient I, to dive in such bottomlesse businesses, bequeath them onely to their
owne repining consciences, just tryalls, and ignominious rewards. To satisfie the
World in my behalfe, as touching my travells, I sincerely protest, that neither ambition,
too much curiosity, nor any reputation I ever sought, from the bubling breath of breathlesse
man (whose <span class="marginnote"><i>The reason why the Author begun his Travels.</i></span>defective censure, inclineth, as instigation, or partiality, moveth his weake and
variable opinion) did expose me to such long peregrinations and dangerous adventures
past. But the proceeding whereof, thousands conjecture the cause, as many the manner;
ten thousand thousands the effect: The condition reserved, I partly forbeare to penetrate
in that undeserved Dalida wrong; and reconciled times pleading desistance, moderate
discretion inserteth silent patience.

</div>
<p class="first">But by your leave, let me enter into consideration of the intractable passage of my
malecontents past, and these importunate designes thereupon ensuing: And thus, have
I, in the late dayes of my younger yeeres beene grievously afflicted? Ah; yea; and
with more then desastrous injuries overclowded, O heavy under-prop&#x2019;d wrongs. But hath
not the like accident befallen to man before? <span class="right-marginnote">[I. 7.]</span>yea; but never the like condition of murther: Nay, but then preponderate seriously
this consequent? may not the scelerate hands of foure blood-shedding wolves? facily
devoure, and shake a peeces, one silly stragling lambe? yea, and most certaine, that
unawares, the harmelesse innocent; unexpecting evill, may suddenly bee surprised by
the ambushment of life-betraying foes. All this I acknowledge; but whereupon grew
this thy voluntary wandring, and unconstrayned exyle? I answere, that being young,
and within minority, in that occurrent time, I was not onely inveigled, but by seducements
inforced, even by the greatest powers, then living in my countrey, <span class="marginnote"><i>A Dialogue betweene the Author and Himselfe.</i></span>to submit my selfe to arbitrement, satisfaction and reconciliation. But afterward
growing in yeeres, and understanding better the nature or such unallowable redresses,
and the hainousnesse of the offence; I choosed rather <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7">7</a>]</span>(<span lang="la">voti causa</span>) to seclude my selfe from my soyle, and exclude my relenting sorrowes, to be entertained
with strangers; then to have a quotidian occular inspection, in any obvious object
of disastrous misfortune: or perhaps any vindicable action, might from an unsetled
ranckour be conceived. O! a plaine demonstrate cause, and good resolution; for true
it is, that the flying from evill, is a flying to grace, and a godly patience is a
victorious freedome, and an undaunted conquerour over all wrongs; Vengeance is mine
(saith the Lord) and I will repay it. To this I answer; mine eyes have seene the revenging
hand of God upon mine adversaries, and these night-gaping foes, are trampled under
foote, whiles I from strength to strength, doe safely goe, through the firy triall
of calamities. My consolation arising from his eternall dictum, <span lang="la">quos amo castigo</span>, whom I love I correct: And to say my part in my soules experience,
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line"><span class="right-marginnote">[I. 8.]</span>I never find affliction fall on me
</p>
<p class="line">Without desert, for God is true and just:
</p>
<p class="line">Nor shall it come, and without profit be,
</p>
<p class="line">For God is good, as mercifull I trust.
</p>
<p class="line xd29e1095">Then welcome all afflictions sent from God,

<p class="first">And as one of the Auncients speaketh well, <span lang="la">Adversa corporis, animæ remedio sunt, ægritudo, carnem vulnerat, sed mentem curat</span>: The affliction of the body is wholesome phisicke for the soule, it woundeth the
flesh, but cureth the spirit. Certaine it is, that the Lord in chastising his owne,
doth often move the wicked reprobates of his wrath, to be the instruments of his correcting
hand. I could involume, as large a discourse, upon this heart-grieving project, as
upon the late intollerable tortures I sustained by the treacherous Governour, and
bloody Inquisition of Malaga in Spaine; being in quality, though not in quantitie
alike. But constantly containing my selfe, within the precinct of patience, referring
such eminences to the Creator, which in a part belongeth not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8">8</a>]</span>to the creature; I may sigh to this world, as sorrowfull Æneas to his Dido.

</div>
<p class="first">But now to proceed in my punctuall purpose, the nature of man, by an inward inclination,
is alwaies inquisitive <span class="right-marginnote">[I. 9.]</span>of forraine newes; yea, and much more affecteth the sight and knowledge of strange,
and unfrequented kingdomes, such is the instinct of his naturall affection. Navigation
hath often united the bodies of Realmes together, but travell hath done much more;
for first to the Actor it giveth the impression of understanding, experience, patience,
and an infinite treasure, of unexprimable vertues: secondly, it unfoldeth to the world,
the government of States, the authority and disposition of Kings and Princes; the
secrets, manners, customes, and Religions of all Nations and People. And lastly, bringeth
satisfaction to the home-dwelling man, of these things, he would have seene, and could
not attempt. Travell hath beene in more request amongst the Ancients, then it is now
with us in the latter Age. Philosophers, Poets, Historiographers, and learned Divines,
how they have perigrinated to know the life of States, and the fashions of farre Countries,
would be an endles taske for me briefly to relate. Many (I confesse) long to see the
remotest Regions of the earth, but dare not undertake the dangers of sight, the chargeable
expences of a tributary journey, the hard indurance of flint stones, for a soft feather
bed, the extremities of thirst, nor the parching heat of the Sun, hunger in the belly,
nor the moist distilling dew to be a humide coverlet to their tender skinne, with
innumerable other insuing miseries. But Ixion-like, mistaking Juno, would by a meere
imagination, runne out the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9">9</a>]</span>sleeping course of an endlesse peregrination. For my part, what I have reaped, is
by a deare-bought knowledge, as it were, a small contentment, in a never contenting
subject, a bitter pleasant tast, of a sweete-seasoned sowre, and all in all, what
I found was more then ordinary rejoycing, in an extraordinary sorrow of delights.
</p>
<p>But now to leave the contemplation of attempts, I <span class="right-marginnote">[I. 10.]</span>come to the reall adventure; After two voyages I made to the Orcadian, and Zetlandian
Isles; in the stripling age of mine adolescency, and there after surveighing all Germany,
Bohemia, Helvetia, and the Low-Countreys from end to end; I visited Paris, where I
remained ten moneths. Divers contestions have I had, about the equality of London,
and Paris, in quantity and quality: But having a more serious subject in hand than
this <span class="marginnote"><i>A comparison betweene London and Paris.</i></span>paralell, I conclude thus, the infinite shipping, and commodious navigation of London
(besides their universall commerce)is more of value, then the better halfe of Paris:
compare you the quantity, for there is the quality of the argument. Paris I confesse
is populous, a masse of poore people, for lacques and pages, a nest of rogues, a tumultuous
place, a noctuall den of theeves, and a confused multitude: Where contrariwise London
is adorned with many grave, prudent and provident Senators, civill, well taught, and
courteous people, and absolutely, the best governed City on the whole face of the
earth, as well by night, as by day, and nothing inferiour in quantity to it.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>From Paris in the yeere of God 1609. March 7. I set forward, being brought three leagues
on my way, with a number of my Countrey gallants, young Aiton, young Hutonhall, and
specially Monsieur Hay of Smithfield, now Esquire of his Majesties body, with diverse
other Gentlemen: where when my kindest thankes had over-clouded their courtesies,
and farewell bid on both sides, I bequeathed my proceedings to God, my body to turmoyling
paines, my hands to the burdon, and my feete to the hard brusing way. And as unwilling
to make <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10">10</a>]</span>relation of my passing through France, the Savoyean, &amp; Ligurian Alpes, sith it is
manifested unto many in this Iland, both by sight and report, I would shunne, so farre
<span class="right-marginnote">[I. 11.]</span>as possible I can, all prolixity of knowne, and therefore unnecessary discourse. Although
I have a large reason, having cros&#x2019;d the Alpes at sixe severall parts, onely, in the
owne place, I meane to comment upon Italy in generall. Upon the 40. day after my departure
from Paris, I arrived at Rome, of the which I will memorize, some rarest things, and
so proceed. This City of Rome now extant, is not that old Rome, which Romulus founded
that tempered the morter with the blood of his brother Rhemus, who disdainefully leaped
over the new wals; and was once the mistresse of the universe, for her triumphs and
antiquities, but is now only the carkas of the other, of which she retaineth nothing
but her ruines, and the cause of them, her sinnes.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The Antiquity of Rome.</i></span>Rome which Romulus first founded, contayned these two mountaines, Capitolino, and
Palatino, with the valley lying betweene both hills: having three ports; the first
was called Trigonio, because of the triangle it made neere to the foote of mount Palatin:
The second Pandonio, because it was alwayes open, and for the commodity of the passage,
it was called the free port: The third was called Carmentale of Carmenta, the mother
of Evander who dwelt there: It was also named scelorata, or wicked gate in regard
of 300. Sabines put cruelly to death issuing thereat.
</p>
<p>Now after the Monarchy of the Romanes had attained to the full height; the Gothes,
a base and unknowne people, displaying their banner, against this glorious and imperiall
City, in the end razed, and subverted their pallaces, equalizing the walles with the
ground. After the which detriment, the overthrow, the late subdued Romans, recovering
their ruinous habitation, were inforced to withdraw the situation of the Towne, a
little more downe-ward, in Campus Martius, close by the <span class="right-marginnote">[I. 12.]</span>bankes of Tibris; and transported the stones of these <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11">11</a>]</span>ransacked buildings, to reedifie their new dwelling places;
</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Where Rome now stands, was sometimes desart woods
</p>
<p class="line">And soyle to feed some few-found bestiall goods.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">And yet Rome was once the famous City of Europe, the mother and nurse of worthy Senators,
the miracle of Nations, the Epitome of the world, the Kingdome of Mars, and the seven
headed soveraigne of many Provinces. <span class="marginnote"><i>Romes seven Hils.</i></span>The seven hills whereon she stood, and now partly somewhere stands: for they are all
contained within the vast bounds of the old walls, which as yet environeth the towne,
are these, Palatino, Capitolina, Viminale, Aventina, Esquiline, Cælio, and Quiraneno.
Which certainely do demonstrate the whoore of Babylon, sitting on the beast with seaven
heads, and cannot be understood but of Rome, being builded on these seven hils: having
a correspondence to seaven Kings who reigned there; and also acknowledging seven severall
Rulers, Kings, Consuls, Decemviri, Tribunes, Dictators, Emperours, and now Popes.
During the felicity of the Romaines, this Citty was never taken, but by the Gauls,
which being recovered they made a Law that Priests (being otherwise exempted) should
goe to warre, if ever the Gauls came againe, with whom they fought not for dominion,
but for their owne preservation: But since it became pontificiall, it hath bene made
a prey to all barbarous Nations, and never was besieged by any that tooke it not.
</p>
<p>The River Tyber which runneth through her bosome, is not unlike to Jordan and Tagus;
yet not so big as either of them, being all three of a troubled and muddy colour:
But it is exceeding outragious, and often Manasseth to <span class="right-marginnote">[I. 13.]</span>drowne the whole Mansions, as greeving to grace the wals of such a wicked and imperious
place: Who having lost her former preheminent glory, and domination over the world,
would now alledge and ascribe a second prerogative <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12">12</a>]</span>over the soules of men, the heavens, the hels, the silver-coyned Purgatory, the deposing
and imposing of Kings: The former was done by the undaunted courage of the invincible
sword, the latter by presumption, Avarice, insinuation, and absurd lyes.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Saint Catherines observation.</i></span>I remember of a pretty observation of Saint Catherine of Siena, who being stricken
in devotion, went to venerate Rome, accompanied with a goodly traine; and having visited
all the Monuments, supposed Holy places, and Religious relickes there, for the space
of five dayes; At last she came to take a view of the Popes Palace, where having spent
a whole day, strictly remarkeing the gesture and carriage of the Popes servants: She
sawe nothing but abhomination, prophanation, and irreligious living, and worser then
in Rome it selfe: Whereuppon suddenly the next day shee departed for Siena, being
an hundreth Miles distant; pittifully bewayling her journey, and the miserable livers
she sawe in Rome. Protesting alwayes after for sixteene yeares time till her death,
that the Winde <span class="marginnote"><i>Meaning of Sodomy.</i></span>never came from the East blowing Westward to Siena, but she thought the filthinesse
of the Popes Palace, and the beastlinesse of Rome, ever stunke in her nose.
</p>
<p>This River of Tyber especially made muster of his extravagant disgorgements, at that
time when Pope Clement 8. was crowned Duke of Ferrara, anno 1589. and that same night
he returned to Rome, Tyber waxed so proud of his arrivall, that impetuously inunding
his bankes to make him welcome, he over-whelmed the <span class="right-marginnote">[I. 14.]</span>better halfe of the Towne: And if it had not bene for the infinite charges of the
Pope, and desperate toile of the people, the violent force of his rage swelling courtesie,
had absolutely subverted and carried away the rest of the City. The like inundation
was never seene of Tyber, as after this Coronation, portending, that as the first
Gomorah was destroyed by fire, so this second Sodome should be sommerssed by water.
The beginning of this River springeth from the Ombrian and Aquilean hills joyning
with the Alpes Appenine: whose course is fourescore <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13">13</a>]</span>and sixteene miles; disburdening it selfe in the sea Mediterren at Ostia twelve miles
from Rome. The mouth and haven whereof have beene long dammed up, to stoppe the passage
of hostile and Moorish incursions, least the City should be surprised on a sudden.
By which slavish Ecclesiasticke feare, Rome is shamefully defrauded of shipping and
forraine trafficke; and if it were not for the Clergy, which are the two parts of
the inhabitants, (besides the Jewes and Curtezans, which are the greatest implements
of the other third part) it would become the most miserable towne in Italy.
</p>
<p>And notwithstanding that for the space of 12. miles round about Rome, there are neither
Cornes, nor Wines, nor Village, Plantage, or Cultivage, save onely playne and pastoragious
fields; intermingled at all quarters with auncient watch-Towers being an old policy
of the Romans, to prevent any sudden surprise of their enimies; insomuch that at my
first view of Rome, I imagined the people were all famished, or in danger of famishing.
</p>
<p>But by your leave, being once enterd the City, I found abundance of all things necessary
for life, at so easie and gentle a rate, that never towne in Europe hitherto could
shew me the like. The common wine that is drunke in <span class="right-marginnote">[I. 15.]</span>Rome, is Vin Romanisco, the better sort Albano, Muscatello, Sheranino, but as for
Lachrime Christi, the teares of Christ, I drew so hard at that same weeping wine,
till I found my purse begun to weepe also; and if time had not prevented the sweetnes
of such teares, I had beene left for all the last miserable mourner. As for the place
<span class="marginnote"><i>The Pilgrimes dinner at the Popes table.</i></span>where the Pilgrimes find one dinner, called the Popes table, it is thus: there is
a certaine low roome at St. Peters Pallace, and without the gate, where every day
at our nine of the clocke, there meete 21. pilgrimes; 14. from the Trinity, one having
a bullet for all, and seven from St Peters Penitentialls: where being received, the
seven Jesuit Pilgrims get the upper place, and sit alone, yet all of them alike served,
each of them having foure dishes of meat, besides bread &amp; abundance of wine. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14">14</a>]</span>dinner done, their fragments are wrapt up in cleane paper, which they carry with them,
and so departing, they, or like company come no more there. They are dayly served
with a very venerable Prelat, and a few other serviceable Preists, but for the Popes
presence with them, there is no such matter. That liberty being spoyld by a drunken
Dutch-man about 60. yeeres agoe, who in presence of the Pope gave up againe his good
cheare and strong wines, with a freer good will then perhaps they were allowed him,
whereat the Pope grewe angry, notwithstanding the drunken fellowe cryed through his
belching throate, Thankes Holy Father, Deere Holy Father, God blesse your Holinesse.
</p>
<p>Many have wrote of the singularities of old Rome, and I will also recite some decayed
monuments thereof, which I have seene: The speciall object of Antiquity I saw, being
never a whit decayed to this day, is the Templum omnium Deorum, but now, omnium sanctorum,
<span class="right-marginnote">[I. 16.]</span>builded in a rotundo, and open at the top with a large round, like to the quire of
the holy grave. And a pretty way from this, are the remainants of that Auncient Amphitheatre
beautified with great Columnes, of a wonderfull bignesse and height, and a mile in
compasse; the reason why it was first devised, the ghosts of the slaughtered <span class="marginnote"><i>Romes Antiquities.</i></span>Sabines may testifie. To be briefe, I saw the decayed house of worthy Cicero, the
high Capitoll, the Pallace of cruell Nero, the Statues of Marcus Aurelius, Alexander,
and his horse Bucephalus. The greene hill like unto mount Cavallo, that was made of
the Potters sheards at one time, which brought the tributary gold to this imperiall
seate: the seven Piramides, some whereof during her former glory, were transported
from Ægypt: The high and small statues of Peter and Paul, the Castell St. Angelo,
which Adrian first founded, standing now in a moderate circumferent height, with incircling
battlements, and their doubtfull transported Reliques from Jerusalem, with many other
things I diligently remarked, some whereof were frivolous, some ambiguous and some
famous.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15">15</a>]</span>
</p>
<p>Neere to mount Palatin, and the decayed temple of Romulus, I saw the Temple of Venus,
converted now to the Church of Sancta Maria, Liberatrice Dalla piene de Inferno, The
deliverer from infernall paynes, as Venus was the Consolatrix of amorous paynes.
</p>
<p>Besides all these I saw one most sight-worthy spectacle, which was the Library of
the auncient Romans, being licentiated to enter with two Gentlemen, Sir William Carre,
Mr. James Aughmuty my Countrey men, where when I was come, I beheld a world of old
Bookes, the first whereof, was an infinite number of Greeke Bibles subscribed with
the hands of these holy Fathers, who (as <span class="right-marginnote">[I. 17.]</span>they say) translated them out of the Hebrew tongue.
</p>
<p>I saw also the Academies of Aristotle, wherein he treateth of the soule, health, life,
nature and qualities of men, with the Medicaments of Galen, for the diseases and <span class="marginnote"><i>Famous Authors.</i></span>infirmities of man: The familiar Epistles of Cicero, the Æneidot of Virgil, the Saphicke
Verses of that Lesbian Sapho, the workes of Ovid, Pliny, Plutarke, Titus Livius, Horatius,
Strabo, Seneca, Plato, Homer, Tirentius, Cato, Hippocrates, Josepus, Pythagoras, Diodorus
Siculus, Eusebius, S. Austine, S. Ambrose, S. Cyprian, S. Gregory, and likewise the
workes of other excellent Phylosophers, Divines and Poets: all wrote with their owne
hands, and sealed with their names, and manuall subscriptions. I saw also the forme
of the first auncient writing which was upon leaves of trees, cakes of lead, with
their fingers on ashes, barkes of trees, with strange figures, and unknowne Letters,
that was brought from Ægypt: for the Ægyptians first devised the use thereof, and
the sight of infinite Obligatory writings of Emperors, Kings and Princes, which I
omit to relate, referring the same to be Registred by the next beholder.

<p>Bidding adew to my company, and this Library, I longed to view the gorgeous Mosaicall
worke of S. Peters Church: The matter was no sooner conceived, but I went to the doore,
yet afraid to enter, because I was not accustomed with the carriage, and ceremonies
of such a Sanctum Sanctorum: but at the last, abandoning all scrupulosities, I came
in boldly, and on my right hand, as I entred within the doore, I espied the portrayed
image of S. Peter <span class="right-marginnote">[I. 18.]</span><span class="marginnote"><i>The brasen Image of Saint Peter.</i></span>erected of pure Brasse, and sitting on a brasen Chaire. The fashion of the people
is this, entring the Church, they go straight to this Idoll, and saluting with many
crosses his senslesse body, kisse his feete, and every one of his severall toes: insomuch
that those his comfortlesse feete are growne firy red, while his body, save his breasts,
remaineth brazen blew: and yet forsooth some of their learned Rabines will not have
this superstition, but an humble commemoration of their adored Saints, or the like,
for procuring favour of intercession, whilst the erected Idoll (interum) receiveth
all their superfluous abhominations of diurnall worship. Next, they lay their heads
under the sole of his right foote, and arising, rub their Beades on his hard costed
belly: thus adoring that breathlesse masse of mettall, more then though it were a
living creature.
</p>
<p>O wonderfull and strange spectacle? that these onely titular Christians, should become
worse of knowledge then Ethnicke Pagans, to worship and reverence the workemanship
of mens hands. Woe and shame be unto you all blind Hereticall Papists; Why should
you make to your selves Idols and Images of gold, silver, brasse, yron, stone, earth
and tree; And notwithstanding would excuse the matter with a superstitious reason,
alledging, you do it onely in remembrance, where otherwise it is a damnable signe
of wilfull obdurate ignorance: May not the prohibition of the 2. Commandement of Gods
Law, which absolutely you abrogate, dividing the last Commandement in two; confound

<p>What vertue can be in a lumpe of brasse? or what comfort in the devices of handy-crafts-men?
Alas, nothing but eternall sorrow &amp; condemnation. This was <span class="right-marginnote">[I. 19.]</span>one of the lamentable errors I saw in the Roman Sea, amongst many other thousands:
When the foolish Listranes or Licaonians would have sacrificed Buls to the honour
of Paul and Barnabas, they rent their cloaths, and ranne in among the people, crying,
and saying; O men, why doe you those things, we are even men subject to the like passions
that you be: How is it then, That the Apostles being alive, would have no acknowledging
by any homage of man; yet when they are dead, the <span class="marginnote"><i>Superstition of Papists.</i></span>Romanists will worship their counterfeit similitude, in stone or tree. What unworthy-fained
traditions and superstitious Idolatry? What strange new devising trickes they use,
to plant idle monasteriall Loyterers? How many manner of wayes these belly-minded
slaves Epicure-like leade their lives? And what a Sea of abhominable villany they
swimme into, practising even unnatural vices, I meane of their wrongfuly called Religious
Bishops, Priests, Friers, Curates, and all the hypocriticall crew, of these pervers&#x2019;d

blood-sucking Inquisitors, of which the most part were mine owne Country-men, the
chiefest of whom was Robert Mophet a Jesuit borne in St. Andrewes, David Chambers,

And for better record Patricke Baxstter, now dwelling in Dundy, and then followed

The more impropriated names were Hesperia, because it is situate under the evening

latebat abditus; and Ænotria in regard of the abundance of wines it produceth. This

<p>The breadth of Italy at the roote and beginning thereof, bending along the Alpes from
the Adriaticke coast, to the riviera di Genoa, or Ligurian shore, is but 240. Italian
miles, growing narrower, and narrower, till it shut out it selfe in two hornes, Calabria,
and Terra di Ottranto. The breadth of which, or either, extendeth not above <span class="right-marginnote">[I. 23.]</span>foureteene English miles from sea to sea, the gulfe Tarento (which is unnavigable
in respect of infinite craggy shelfes) deviding the two homes. On the North side of
Terra di Ottranto, lieth Apulia, bordering with Mare superum, a very fruitfull soile
for cornes; &amp; West-ward thence boundeth, terra di lavoro, or proprium regnum Napolitanum.
These foure territories make up the intire <span class="marginnote"><i>The Kingdome of Naples.</i></span>Kingdome of Naples: The chiefe Cities of which, are Naples, Capua and Salerno, in
terra di Lavoro: In Calabria, are Cousenza, the chiefe seate of the President, or

the which towne being <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21">21</a>]</span>taken by Mahomet the great, Anno 1481. involved all Italy in such a feare, that for
a whole yeare, and till the expulsion of the Turks, Rome was quite forsaken, the next
are Lucia, and Brundusium beautified with a famous haven.
</p>
<p>And in Apulia, are Manfredo, Arpino where Tully was borne, Venusio, whence Horace
had his birth, and Canno famous for the victory of Hanniball, against the Romans.
The Church-land beginnes beyond Rome eighty miles at Terracina, being just opposit
to Gayetta, the West-most confine by the Marine of the Neapolitan Kingdome, neare
to Mount Circello, and the utmost Marine limit Eastward of Campagna di Roma, or the
Churches patrimony, imbracing both seas, till it runne to Ponto Centino in Tuscana:
which divideth the precincts of Re di Coffine, &amp; Aquacupadente, the last frontiers
of the great Duke and Popes lands. All which bounds to Terracina, and in the way of
Venice from Rome to Spaleto is denominated Campagna di Roma, or Latium; and thence
it reacheth along Northwest, by the Venetian gulfe, to the uttermost bounds of the
Dutchy of Ferara, being thirty miles from Venice: Extending in length to three hundred
&amp; fifty <span class="right-marginnote">[I. 24.]</span>miles, whose breadth is narrow, and where it joyneth with both seas, it is but sixty
miles. The Church-land is <span class="marginnote"><i>The foure Papall Territories.</i></span>divided in foure territories, Campagna di Roma, or old Latium; Rome, Viterbo, Narni,
Tarni, Viletri, Montefiascone, and Civitavecchia, being the chiefe Cities: Next, the
Countrey of Ombria, or Ombrosa, lying betweene Rome and Loretta, the chiefe Cities
are Spaleto, from whence it is reckoned a Dutchy, Perugia, a Sacerdotall University,
Fulino, and Asisi, where great St. Frances with his invisible Stigmata was borne.
At the which Asisi, I saw the place (as they say) where the Angell appeard to his
mother, telling her, that she should conceave and beare a sonne, should be the Champion
of Jesus, and hard by they shew me the Crub or Stall where he was borne, with many
other foolish lyes both sinfull and abhominable: every way representing his imaginary

is Marca di Ancona by the sea side, Ancona being principall, the other Cities are
Asculi, Marcerata, Tolentino, Riginati, Aguby, and Parasiticall Loretta. The fourth
is Romania, lying along toward Ferrara, betweene the sea, and the hills Appenine.
</p>
<p>This Ecclesiasticke dowry of Romania, is disjoyned from Marca di Ancona, by the Duke
of Urbins lands, which division by the sea side is thirty miles in length, containing
Pesaro, Fanno, and Sinigalia all sea port Townes, the other of this Dutchy are Urbino,

the other of this principality, are Pisa, Siena, Pistoia, Empoli, Ligorne, and Arretzo.
</p>
<p>From Tuscany to the West, and North-west, lieth Lumbardy, intituled the garden of
the World, which is now divided (besides the Venetian territory, of which I will speake
in the owne place) in foure principalities, Milaine, Mantua, Parma and Modena: The
other Cities be Cremona, Pavia, Lodi, Pleasance, Rhegio Brisiles, Palestra, Navarro
and Allessandria di Paglia. This Province is mainely watered through the middle with
stately Po, in which Phaeton was drenched, when he came tumbling downe from Heaven.
The Rivers Ladishe, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23">23</a>]</span>Montanello, Delia Guarda, and other forcible streames supporting the shoulders of

<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Piemont and Genuaes Jurisdictions.</i></span>West from Lumbardy lieth Piemont, betweene it and Savoy: The City whereof, and wherein
the Savoyan Duke hath his Residence is Torino, situate on Po. The other, Aste Verseilles
and Cowie. South from Piemont and Lumbardy, lieth the Riviera of Genoa, along the
Mediterrean sea: the territory of which is narrow, but above one hundreth miles in
length: All which is exceeding rocky and mountainous, yet producing good store of
Orenges, Lemmons, Figges and Ches-nuts, whereon the Mountaineri <span class="right-marginnote">[I. 26.]</span>onely live, being either rosted, or baked in bread: The chiefe Cities of this Genewesen
Liguria, are Genoa, <span class="marginnote"><i>Italy lyeth as the right arme, reaching forth from the maine body of Europe.</i></span>and Savona. Italy lying in forme of a legge, is on both sides environed with the Sea,
save onely the North-west part, and roote thereof, which is devided from France and
Germany, by the Ligurian, Savoyean, Grisonean, Zingalian, and Tirolian alpes, which
bend North-east, and South-west, inclosing it from the body of Europe, from sea to
sea. Italy of all other Regions under the Sunne, hath beene most subject to the vicissitude
of Fortune, yet not a little glorying in these famous Captaines, Fabius Maximus the
buckler, and Camillus the sword of Rome, Scipio, Pompey, and Cæsar; for venerable
Poets Virgil, Ovid, and renowned Horace, famous also for the Orator Cicero, and the
Historians Tacitus, and Livius: The soyle is generally abundant in all things necessary
for humane life, and the people for the most part are both grave and ingenious, but
wondrous deceitfull in their actions, so unappeasable in anger, that they cowardly
murther their enemies rather then seeke an honourable revenge, and so inclind to unnaturall
vices, that for bestiality they surpasse the Infidells: the women of the better sort
are slavishly infringed from honest and lawfull liberty: They of the middle ranke
somewhat modest in carriage, witty in speech, and bountifull in affection: They of
the vulgar kind are both ignorant, sluttish and greedy, and lastly the worser dregs,
their impudent Curtezans, the most lascivious <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24">24</a>]</span>harlots in the world. This much in generall for the briefe description of this Region,
and so I revert to mine itinerary relation.
</p>
<p>In the meane while, having alwayes a regard of my hasty dispatching from Christendome,
I returned through Terra di Lavoro, by the sea side, Campagna di Roma, aunciently
Latium, and Ombria, now the Dutchy of <span class="right-marginnote">[I. 27.]</span>Spaleto, even to Loretta, standing in the Marca of Ancona, addressing my selfe to
Venice for transportation. But by your leave, let me lay downe before your eyes some
notable illusions of Modonna di Loretta, which I found in my way-faring journey, to
amplifie my former discourse, concerning the errours of the Roman Church, and as yet
was never Englished in our language.
</p>
<p>Before I came neare to Loretta by tenne miles, I overtooke a Caroch, wherein were
two Gentlemen of Rome, and their two Concubines; who when they espied me, saluted
me kindly, enquiring of what Nation I was? whither I was bound? and what pleasure
I had to travell alone? After I had to these demands given satisfaction, they intreated
me to come up in the Caroch, but I thankfully refused, and would not, replying the
way was faire, the weather seasonable, and my body unwearied. At last they perceiving
my absolute refusall, presently dismounted on the ground, to recreate themselves in
my company: and incontinently, the two young unmarried Dames came forth also, and
would by no perswasion of me, nor their familiars mount againe; saying, they were
all Pilgrimes, and bound to Loretta (for devotion sake) in pilgrimage, and for the
pennance enjoyned to them by their Father Confessour. Truely so farre as I could judge,
their pennance was small, being carried with horses, and the appearance of their devotion
much lesse: for lodging at Riginati, after supper, each youth led captive his dearest
Darling to an unsanctified bed, and left me to my accustomed repose.
</p>
<p>When the morning Starre appeared, we imbraced the way marching towards Loretta, and
these vermillion <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25">25</a>]</span>Nymphs, to let me understand they travelled with a chearefull stomacke, would oft
runne races, skipping like <span class="right-marginnote">[I. 28.]</span>wanton Lambes on grassie Mountaines, and quenching their follies in a Sea of unquenchable
fantasies. Approaching neare the gate of the Village, they pulled off their shooes
and stockings, walking bare-footed through the streets, to this tenne thousand times
polluted Chappell, mumbling Paternosters, and Ave Mariaes on their beads. When they
entred the Church, wherein the Chappell <span class="marginnote"><i>Ignorant devotion.</i></span>standeth, I stood at the entry beholding many hundreds of bare-footed blinded bodies,
creeping on their knees and hands: Thinking themselves not worthy to goe on foote
to this idely supposed Nazaretan House, like to this saying;
</p>

<p class="first">Unto this falsely patronized Chappell, they offer yearely many rich gifts, amounting
to an unspeakable value, as Chaines, &amp; Rings of Gold and Silver, Rubies, Diamonds,
silken Tapestries, Goblets, imbroudries and such like. <span class="marginnote"><i>Romes avarice.</i></span>The Jesuiticall and P&#x153;nitentiall Fathers receive all, but who so enjoy all, let Camera
reverenda Romana, graunt certification to this Loretan avariciousnesse, who fill their
coffers twice in the yeare therewith. My foure Pilgrimes having performed their ceremoniall
customes, came backe laughing, and asked why I did not enter? But I as unwilling to
shew them any further reason, demaunded what the matter was? O (said the Italians)
Jurando per il Cieloe Iddio Sacratissimo; This is the House wherein the Virgin Marie
dwelt in Galile: and to the confirmation of these words shewed me a Booke, out of
which I extracted these Annotations.
</p>
<p>This Chappell they hold it to be the house, in which <span class="right-marginnote">[I. 29.]</span>Mary was annunced by Gabriel, and wherein she conceived <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26">26</a>]</span><span class="marginnote"><i>Damnable illusions of Loretta.</i></span>Jesus, by operation of the holy Ghost, &amp; in the meane time, that devotion waxed scant
amongst the Christians of the Primitive Church in the Holy Land: strangers tirannizing
over the territories of Canaan, as Heraclius, Costroes King of Persia, Sarazens, and
Harancone King of Ægypt; it came to passe in the yeare of our Lord, 1291. and in the
time of Pope Nicholas the fourth, that it being shaken off the foundation, was transported
miraculously by Angels in the night, from Nazareth in Gallilee, to Torsalto in Slavonia:
the distance being by sea and land 17. hundred Italian miles, O! a long lift for so
scurvie a Cell. And in the morning, Shepheards comming to the place of pastorage,
found this house, wherewith being astonished, they returned in hast, and told Saint
George Alessandro, the Prior of Torsalto, who in that meane while was lying sick.
He being stricken in admiration with these newes, caused himselfe to be borne thither,
and laid before the Altar, and falling in a marvellous trance, <span class="marginnote"><i>A Simonaicall vision.</i></span>the Virgin Mary by a heavenly Vision appeared to him, saying after this manner.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>A Papisticall Dreamd of Oration.</i></span>Behold, thou hast often pierced the heavens, with invocations for thy reliefe, and
now I am come, not onely to restore thee to thy health, but also to certifie thee,
that thou doubt nothing of this House; for it is holy in respect of mee, the chast
immaculate Virgin, ordained before all eternity, to be the Mother of the most High.
It was in this Chamber my Mother Anna conceived me, nourished me, and brought me up,
in singing Psalmes, Hymnes, and Praises to the glory of God; and also I kept in this
roome the blessed Infant Jesus very God, and very Man, without any grievance or paine
brought him up with all dilgent observation: And when <span class="right-marginnote">[I. 30.]</span>cruell Herod sought the Babes life, by the advertisement of the Angell, I, and my
husband Joseph, who never knew my body, fled with him downe to Ægypt. And after his
passion, death, and ascension to Heaven, to make a reconciliation of humane nature,
with the Court <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27">27</a>]</span>C&#x153;lestiall: I stayed in this house with John, and the other Disciples: Who considering
after my death, what high mysteries had beene done into it, consecrated and converted
the same to a Temple, for a commemoration of Christs sufferings, the chiefe of Martyrs.
Also that resplending Image thou seest, was made by Saint Luke (my familiar) for eternizing
the memory of my portraiture, as I was alive, by the commandement of him, who doth
all things, and shall reserve this sacred Image to the worlds end: That Crosse of
Ceder, which standeth at the side of the little Westerne window, was made by the Apostles:
These Cinders in the Chimney touch not, because they are the fragments of the last
fire I made on earth: And that Shelfe whereon my linnen clothes, and prayer Bookes
lay, Let no person come neere it: For all these places are sanctified and holy. Wherefore
my Sonne, I tell thee, awake, and goe recite the same which I have told thee unto
others; and to confirme thy beleefe therein, the Queene of Heaven giveth thee freely
thy health.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The shamefull opinions of the Papists concerning Loretta.</i></span>Frier Alexander being ravished (say they) with the Vision, went and reported it to
Nicholas Frangipano, Lord of that Countrey. And incontinently he sent this Prior and
other foure Friers to Nazareth, whereby he might know the trueth thereof, but in that
journey they dyed. The Virgin Mary perceiving their incredulity, caused Angels the
second time to transport the house over the gulfe of Venice, to a great wood neere
by the sea side, in the territory of Riginati in Italy, being 300. miles distant.
Which, when the country-men had found, and <span class="right-marginnote">[I. 31.]</span>remarking the splendor of the illuminating Image, dispersed these newes abroad. And
the Citizens of Riginati, having seene what great miracles was daily done, by the
vertue of this Chappell, imposed then to it this name, Our Lady of Miracles. A little
while after the people resorting to it with rich gifts, there haunted in the wood
many theeves and cut-throates, who robd and murthered the Pilgrims. Which innocent
spilt bloud, pricking their pitifull Lady to the heart, she made the Angels transport
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28">28</a>]</span>it the third time, and set it on the top of a little Mountaine, belonging to two brethren
in heritage, being forty foure miles distant from the former place. But they upon
a day quarrelling, and discording about the utility of the <span class="marginnote"><i>Foure times transported.</i></span>Offerings to this House, the Angels did remoove it the fourth time, and placed it
in a high broad way, where it standeth unremooved to this day, which place is now
called the Village of Loretta; and from the last Station nine miles distant. <span class="marginnote"><i>A confirmation by the Popes.</i></span>This was confirmed by the Papall authority to be of an undoubted trueth, after a hundreth
and fifty three yeares deliberation. Loe, as briefly as I could, have I layd open
to thy judicious eyes, the transportations, Originall, and Papisticall Opinions of
Loretta; protesting I have added nothing to the Authours description, but onely collected
these speciall Warrants; omitting other infinite foolish toyes, conceived for their
blind-folded credulity.
</p>
<p>This Chappell, or rather dwelling house, as they would have it, stood alwayes alone,
till of late, that Pope Clement 8. caused build a glorious Church over it: And here
by accident I encountred with a very courteous and discreet Gentleman, James Arthur,
whose company was to me most acceptable: Our acquaintance being first made at the
<span class="right-marginnote">[I. 32.]</span>beginning of the same voiage upon the mountaines of Ferrara in Paese du Burbon, and
bound to visite Venice, in his returning home for Scotland, as well as he had done
Rome and other Cities of Italy.
</p>
<p>Now I remember here of a pretty jest, for he and I going in to see the inravled image
with sparrets of iron, and musing on the blacknesse of her face, and the richnesse
of her gowne, all set with precious Stones and Diamonds; and because she is sightlesse,
foure lampes of oyle they keepe alwayes burning before her face, that the people may
see her, because she cannot see them. There was, I say, a young lusty woman hard by
my elbow, busie at <span class="marginnote"><i>A fleshly false-sprung miracle.</i></span>her Beades, who with the heate of the throng, and for lacke of ayre, fell straight
in a sound: the women about her gave a shoute, and cryd that our blessed Lady had
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29">29</a>]</span>appeared to her; whereupon she was carried forth and layd upon the steppes, that discend
from the Chappell to the Church-floore, five hundreth more come to visite her with
salutations of Saint, Saint, O ever blessed Saint; Now it was Friday in the fore-noone,
and the woman having travelled all night, and to save charges of fish, had eaten a
cold bit of her owne meat privately in the Taverne, with halfe a Buckale of red Wine:
The people more admiring this imaginary heavenly trance, than the reliefe of the woman;
at last sayd I, brother Arthur, I will goe open yonder womans breast, and I did so:
and holding up her head before all the people, there sprung a flood of vin garbo downe
the Alabaster stayres, intermingled with lumpes of ill-chewd flesh: Whereat the people
being amazed, from a Saint swore she was a Divell: And if my friend and I, had not
made hast to carry the sicke woman from the Church to a Taverne, doubtlesse, they
had stoned her to death; and here was one of their miracles.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[I. 33.]</span>Another time, comming backe from my second Travels in Affricke, it was my lucke to
stumble in here againe, where I saw an old Capuschin Frier conjuring the Divell out
of a possessed woman, who had stayed there, and two men keeping her above eighteene
moneths, being twise a day brought before the Chappell. The Frier stood up before
her, the two men holding both her armes; <span class="marginnote"><i>A Capuschin Frier conjuring the Divell.</i></span>and sayd, laying his formost finger on her brow; <span lang="it">In nomine Patris, &amp;c. Io vi cargo a dirmi, per quale cagione, havete posseduto l&#x2019;anima
di questæ poveretta; &amp; vati ne via io ti adjuro, alia quei luogi, dionde tu sei venuto</span>: I charge thee to shew me for what cause thou hast possessed the soule of this poore
wretch, and I adjure thee to goe backe unto these places from whence thou camest.
Meane while the woman stood dumbe and silent for the space of a quarter of an howre,
not being usuall before: the people gave a shoute, and cry&#x2019;d, the Divell had left
her, whereat he that held her right arme did let it fall downe by her side: But by
your leave, in the twinckling of an eye, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30">30</a>]</span>Divell in the woman gave the Frier such a rattle in the face, that he was stroke downe
upon his backe among the people: And if it had not bene that she was borne downe with
strength of hands, she had torne the silly old conjurer in peeces: crying, O false
and dissembling knave, pretendest thou to have power to cast out evill Spirits, when
thou thy selfe is in a worser case than I, and all thy profession too; Hell, hell,
is your reward.
</p>
<p>This is another of our Lady of Lorettaes Miracles, though many moe I could recite:
As for any more vertue of this Cymberian image, I have knowne sicke folkes loaden
with all kinde of diseases, criples, lame, maimed, deafe, dumbe, and numbers possessed
with evill spirits lie here before this Lady, till I returned againe from Asia &amp; Affrick,
that same way: imploring, fasting and <span class="right-marginnote">[I. 34.]</span>penitentially weeping for health; But alas poore soules, they lost their labour. When
they had both spent all their meanes, and perhaps the poorest of them three yeares
attendance, and forced to my knowledge to returne againe to their severall stations
with sorrowfull and comfortlesse hearts.
</p>
<p>O strange and wonderfull frailty of men! what damnable imperfections domineere over
their brain-sicke knowledge: Sathan, thou Prince of darkenesse, hast so over-sylled
the dimmed eies of their wretched soules, that notwithstanding of Gods eternall word,
ordained to call them through the spotlesse bloud of Christ Jesus<span class="corr" id="xd29e1539" title="Source: )">;</span> to be the heires and adopted sonnes of Salvation: yet thou all abhominable enemie
of mankind, overthrowest both their spirituall and naturall understanding in a bottome­lesse
Ocean of darke ignorance; promising to thy obdurate souldiers, to build Castles in
the Ayre; and contrarywise is busie, digging downe dungeons, to welcome thy hellish
eternized guests, with horrible torments, and never-ceasing flames of everlasting
fire. What wilfull-hearted man can be so apt to believe, that our blessed Lady, had
such estimation of morter and stones, as to have (although she had, had power) caused
Angells to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31">31</a>]</span>transport a rotten house so often? No, I say, beleeve it who so will; questionlesse,
the Judgements of God in the trueth of his all-seeing Justice, shall reward their
too credulous mindes accordingly; Then shall they know their foolish and superstitious
errours.
</p>
<p>But now to leave them with their Idolatry to stones, mettall, and Images, I come to
their blasphemies against the sacred Deity: Looke to the workes of Bernardini de Busti,
Bonaventure, and Fereolus Lucrius, how shamefully they derogate the glory from God,
and attribute all grace, mercy and omnipotency, to the Virgin Mary. So <span class="right-marginnote">[I. 35.]</span>Ludolphus and Chrysostome affirme, that Velocior est non unquam salus invocato nomine
Mariæ, quam invocato nomine Domini, vinci filii ejus: Men may oftentimes be sooner
saved by calling on the Virgin Mary, than on Christ. Omnia quæ Dei sunt, Mariæ sunt,
quia mater &amp; sponsa Dei illa est, all things which are Gods, are the Virgin Maries,
because she is both the Spouse, and the mother of God, saith a Rabbin of theirs: and
as many creatures honour the Virgin Mary, as honour the Trinity, saith another: So,
Imperio Virginis, omnia famulantur &amp; Deus, all creatures &amp; God himselfe, are subject
to the Virgin Maries command. And in their Bonaventure Ladies Psalter, Monstrate esse
matrem, &amp; coge illum peccatoribus misereri, Shew thy selfe a Mother, and compell him
(viz. Christ) to have mercy upon sinners. Infinit citations could I produce, of such
like intollerable <span class="marginnote"><i>The Virgin Mary divided in a thousand Ladies.</i></span>attributs, besides the dividing of her in a 1000 stiles, viz. The Lady of the wines,
Lady of the oyles, Lady of the cornes, Lady of the woods, Lady of the mountains, Lady
of the meeds, Lady of the sheepe and goats, Lady of the springs, Lady of the fire,
Lady of the shepheards; from earthquakes, thunder and fire-flashes, Lady of the Angels
which is at Asisi in Ombria, Lady of miracles in divers places, Florence, &amp;c. Lady
of life in Bullogna newly found, Lady of all noble Ladies, and Nunnes, Lady of the
galley-slaves, Lady of shipwracking seas, Lady of rivers and waters, Lady of young
children, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32">32</a>]</span>orphanes, Lady of all consolation, Lady of pure Virgins, Lady of distressed widdows,
Lady of the sicke, and women with child, &amp;c. Besides the powerfull Lady of Mountserrata
in Catalogna, the aforesayd miraculous Lady of Loretta, and the clementious Ile-ruling
Lady of Trapundy in Sicilia, &amp;c. Thus they make it manifest, <span class="right-marginnote">[I. 36.]</span>that Shee, that is Ladye of the one, is not Ladye of the other; each of them having
divers gifts, divers graces, divers powers, as they alledge, divers Chappells, divers
offerings, and divers pilgrimages, according to the severall seasons, eminent or past-perills,
peculiar invocations, and the particular neede of each family, man woman and living
creature.
</p>
<p>Whereby it plainely appeareth, by their dividuall acknowledgements, she is neither
superior in power, universall in power, nor equall in power to God: For if she were,
one Chappell, one name, one place, one pilgrimage, one offering would suffice for
all. They chatter over on their beads ten Ave Maries to our Lady, and but one Pater
noster to Christ: They make their orations thrice a day in the streets to the Virgin,
and none to God: they say God divided the Kingdome with the Virgin, reserving to himselfe
Justice, graunted to his mother mercy, wherefore if any man be aggrieved with Gods
Justice, he may appeale to the court of her mercy.
</p>
<p>But to conclude their blasphemies, &amp; horrible lies, blessed is the blessed Virgin
Mary (the Mother of Christ according to the flesh) above all women for ever and ever.
</p>
<p>Leaving both this and Loretta, and returning to my <span class="marginnote"><i>Ancona.</i></span>purpose, James Arthur and I imbarked at Ancona, (15. miles from thence) in a Frigato;
This City of Ancona, in the time of Trajanus the Emperour, flourished mightily in
fame, and reputation, and yet a gallant place to this day;

having a faire haven built by Trajanus. It hath but one <span class="right-marginnote">[I. 37.]</span>gate, whence arose the proverbe, Un porto nel Ancona, un Petro nel Roma, e un Torre
nel Cremona, One gate in Ancona, one Peter in Rome, and one Steeple in Cremona being
exceeding high.
</p>
<p>Along this Adriaticke Coast, I saw no remarkeable thing, save the two Cities Rimini
and Ravenna: which were famous in the dayes of Octavius Cæsar, but now somewhat impoverished,
in regard of divers incursions sustained, and shoaring along with them, the Duke of
Urbines three sea-port Townes Sinigalia, Fanno and Pesaro, we sayled by the mouth
of Rubicon, called now Pissatello (which Julius Cæsar passed over, against the ordinance
of the Senate, and afterwards seazed upon Rome, putting Pompey to flight) I saw the
place, where the bloudy battell was fought betweene the French and Spaniards, Anno
Domini 1512. but the victory fell to the Gaules, with the losse of nineteene thousand
men on every side, and they have erected singular Monuments there, in a perpetuall
memory thereof. After three dayes sayling (having passed by Malamucko, which is the
Haven of the great Venetian shippes) we arrived at St. Marks place in Venice.
</p>
<p>Mine associate and I, were no sooner landed, and perceiving a great throng of people,
and in the midst of them a great smoake; but we begun to demaund a Venetian what the
matter was? who replied, there was <span class="marginnote"><i>A Gray Frier burned for villanous Lechering.</i></span>a gray Frier burning quicke at S. Markes pillar, of the reformed order of S. Francis,
for begetting fifteene young Noble Nunnes with child, and all within one yeare; he
being also their Father confessor. Whereat, I sprung forward through the throng, and
my friend followed me, and came just to the pillar as the halfe of his body and right
arme fell flatlings in the fire; The Frier was forty <span class="right-marginnote">[I. 38.]</span>sixe yeares old, and had bene Confessor of that Nunnery <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34">34</a>]</span>of Sancta Lucia five yeares: Most of these young Nunnes were Senators daughters; and
two of them were onely come in to learne vertue, and yet fell in the midst of vice.
</p>
<p>These fifteene with child, were all re-cald home to their fathers Pallaces; the Lady
Prioresse, and the rest of her voluptuous crew, were banished for ever from the precincts
of Venice. The Monastery was razed to the ground, their rents were allowed to be bestowed
upon poore families, and distressed age, and their Church to be converted to an Hospitall.
Most part of all which M. Arthur and I saw, before ever we either eate, drunke, or
tooke our lodging in Venice: And I cannot forget, how after all this, we being inhungred,
and also over-joyed tumbled in by chance, Alla capello Ruosso, the greatest ordinary
in all Venice, neare to which the Friars bones were yet a burning: And calling for
a Chamber, we were nobly &amp; richly served: After dinner they layd up our budgets and
our burdons, and abroad went we to see the Citie: Night come, we supd, and supd alone:
<span class="marginnote"><i>The chiefe Venetian Ordinery.</i></span>The next morne, I begun to remarke the grandeur of the Inne, and saw it was time that
we were gone: I demanded our dependant, what was to pay? he answered, Un scudo all
huomo par ciascun ripasto, A Crowne the dyet for each of us, being ten Julets or five
shillings starling: Mr. Arthur lookd upon me, and I laughd upon him: In a word our
dinner and supper cost us 40. Juletts twenty shillings English; being foure Crownes,
whereat my companion being discontented, bad the divell be in the Friars ballocks,
for we had payd soundly for his Leachery: many like deaths, for like causes, and worser,
have I seene in all my three voyages, if time could permit me to particularize them;

<p>Venice is a Garden of riches, and worldly pleasures the chiefe flowre of Common-weales,
and the perfect, mirrour of civill and politicke Governement. This sequestrat Citty,
is situate in the bosome of Neptune, and divided from the world, with a part of his
maine body, which invironeth the Iland.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The territories of Venice.</i></span>The Common-wealth of Venice, containeth Marcha del Trevisa, which lieth in Lombardy,
containing these Cities, Trevisa, Padua, Vincenza, Verona, Briscia, the second City
for bignesse and beauty in all Lombardy, Bergamo, Chiozza, and Rovigno. Friuli, formerly
called Forum Julii, lieth in the straite betweene the East end of the Alpes, and the
sea Adriaticke, in length fifty, &amp; in bredth forty miles. It hath bene often subject
to the vicissitude of fortune: The chiefe towne is Treista in the bottome of the gulfe,
and Palma lately built by the Venetians 1583. being the most impregnable, and best
fortified towne in Italy: Friuli was a Dukedome, founded by the Lombards at the beginning
of the Venetian Common-wealth: Afterward Luitprandus one of the Dukes, envying the
increase of the dominion of Venice, made war against them, which ended in the losse
of his owne countrey. The rest be Istria, a part of Dalmatia, the Ilands Candy, Corfu,
Zante, Cephalonia, Serigo, Tino, Val di Campare, Lesina, and others of lesser note.
</p>
<p>The Venetians howsoever of old, they have bene great warriours; they are now more
desirous to keepe, then inlarge their Dominions, and that by presents and money, <span class="right-marginnote">[I. 40.]</span>rather than by the sword or true valour; so that whatsoever they loose by battell,
it is observed, they recover againe by treatise. The Venetians are sayd to have discended
of the Hennets in Asia lesser, who assisting
</p>
<p>the Trojans, and Troy being lost, their King Pterilimene slaine, they fled away with
Antenor; and arriving in this part of Italy seated themselves, till the report of
the Hunnes designe against Italy, made them, (avoyding the storme before it fell)
to draw into these Ilands and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36">36</a>]</span><span class="marginnote"><i>The first plantation of Venice.</i></span>Marishes, where now it standeth. It was first founded, and begun, Anno. 421. March
25. being distant from the maine land five miles, and defended against the fury of
the sea, by a banke extending to fifty miles in length: Through which in eight places,
there is passage broken for small boates, but no way for vessels of any burthen, save
at Malamucco, and the castle of Lio: Yea, and so dangerous, that there is neither
out-going nor in-comming, without a Pylot, which maketh the Citty unconquerable.
</p>
<p>This Citty is seven miles in compasse, and from so base an abject beginning, it is
growne (as it were) to be the chiefe bulwarke of Europe: The Duke of this Adriatick
Queene, espouseth the sea, every Ascension day, by casting a golden ring into it.
Which Stultitious ceremony by Pope Alexander the third was graunted, when he fled
to Venice for succour, being persecuted by Fredericke Barbarossa: And the Venetians
vanquishing Otho the Emperours sonne, restored the Pope, and for a reward, was honoured
with this espousall.
</p>
<p>The length of the Territory of Venice in Lombardy, lying along the foote and South
side of the Alpes, amounteth to sixe score five miles: The breadth whereof in the
planure is narrow, but stripeth larger among the hills and lakes, and very populous.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[I. 41.]</span>The applauding Italian sayth, that Europe is the head of the World, Italy the face
of Europe, and Venice the eye of Italy; and indeed, it is the strongest, and most
active part of that powerfull body: Whereby it would appeare, that in the last subversion
of the latter <span class="marginnote"><i>The Venetians are sprung of the Romans.</i></span>Monarchy, the Romane Genius made a Pythagoricall transmigration into Venice; whose
peace hath procured the plenty, and whose warres the peace of all Christendome. The
lawes of this City permit not the younger sonnes of the best Gentry to marrie, least
the number increasing should deminish the dignity: Yet neverthelesse they permit them
unlawfull pleasures, and for their sakes allow publicke stewes. The Jewes here, and
in Rome, weare red, and yellow hats for notice sake, to distinguish <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37">37</a>]</span>them from others: which necessary custome (would to God) were enjoyned to all the
Papists here in England, so should we easily discerne them from the true Christians.
And finally, to discourse upon the provision of their magnificent Arsenall, Artillery,
Munition and Armor, the division of streetes with channels, the innumerable bridges
of stone and timber, their accustomable kind of living, apparell, curtesies, and conventions;
and finally, the glory of Gallants, Galleries, Gallies, Galleasses and Gallouns, were
a thing impossible for me briefly to relate. Wherefore since the situation thereof,
and the decorements of their beautifull Palaces, are so well knowne, and their generall
customes by the better sort, I desist, concluding thus; this incomparable mansion
is the onely Paragon of all Cities in the World.
</p>
<p>Mine aforesaid Consort and I having spent ten dayes in viewing and reviewing this
City and circumjacent Isles, and my purpose reaching for Greece and Asia, as his was
to recrosse the snowy Alpes, my muse remembreth our sad departure.

<p class="first">In the time of my staying here, I went forth to Lombardy, and visited the famous Cities
of Padua, Verona, and Ferrara. The commendation of which is celebrated in these verses:
</p>
<div lang="la" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Extollit Paduam, juris studium, &amp; medicinæ.

<p class="line">Verona, humanæ dat singula commoda vitæ.

</div>
<p class="first">In Padua I stayed three moneths learning the Italian tongue, and found there a Countrey
Gentleman of mine, Doctor John Wedderburne a learned Mathametician, but now dwelling
in Moravia, who taught me well in the language, and in all other respects exceeding
friendly <span class="right-marginnote">[I. 43.]</span>to me. Padua is the most melancholy City of Europe, the cause onely arising of the
narrow passage of the open streets, and of the long galleries and dark-ranges of pillars,
that goe alwhere on every hand of you, through the whole streets of the Towne: The
Schollers here in the night commit many murthers against their privat adversaries,
and too often executed upon the stranger and innocent, and all with gun-shot or else
stilettoes: for beastly Sodomy, it is as rife here as in Rome, Naples, Florence, Bullogna,
Venice, Ferrara, Genoa, Parma not being exempted, nor yet the smallest Village of
Italy: A monstrous filthinesse, and yet to them a pleasant pastime, making songs,
and singing Sonets of the beauty and pleasure of their Bardassi, or buggerd boyes.
</p>
<p>I commend the devotion of Venice and Genua, beyond all the other Cities of Italy;
for the Venetians have banished the Jesuites out of their Territories and Ilands:
<span class="marginnote"><i>A comparison of Jewes and Jesuits.</i></span>And the Genueses have abandoned the society of Jewes, and exposed them from their
jurisdiction. The Jewes and the Jesuites are brethren in blasphemies; for the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39">39</a>]</span>Jewes are naturally subtill, hatefull, avaritious, and above all the greatest calumniators
of Christs name: and the ambitious Jesuites, are flatterers, bloudy-gospellers, treasonable
tale-tellers, and the onely railers upon the sincere life of good Christians. Wherefore
I end with this verdict, the Jew and the Jesuite, is a Pultrone and a Parasite.

<p class="xd29e1741"><span class="xd29e1741init">A</span>fter my returne from Padua to Venice &amp; 24. days attendance devasted there for passage,
I imbarked in a Carmoesalo, being bound to Zara Novo in Dalmatia: Scarcely had we
lost the sight of Venice, but we incountred with a deadly storme at Seroco e Lenante<span class="corr" id="xd29e1743" title="Not in source">.</span> The Master had no compasse to direct his course, neither was he expert in Navigation;
because they use commonly, either on the South or North sides of the Gulfe, to hoise
up sayles at night, and againe breake of day they have full sight of land; taking
their directions from the topped hills of the maine continent. The tempest increasing,
and the winds contrary, we were constrained to seeke up for the Port of Parenzo in
Istria.
</p>
<p>Istria was called Giapidia, according to Pliny; Cato affirmeth it was called Istria
of one Isiro, but by the moderne writers, <span lang="it">l&#x2019;ultima Regione di Italia</span>. By Ptolomeus it is sayd to be of length 100. miles, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41">41</a>]</span>forty large, but by mine experience onely 80. long and 20. large.
</p>
<p>Istria hath on the South Friuli and the sea: on the West Stria: on the North Carniola:
on the East the gulfe <span class="marginnote"><i>The antiquity of the Istrians.</i></span>Carnaro or Quevero. It is thought the Istrians were first a people of Colchis in Natolia,
who by King Ætas being sent to pursue Jason and the Argonauts (who had stolne the
golden fleece and his daughter Medea) either because of the long journey, or feare
of the Kings anger <span class="right-marginnote">[II. 45.]</span>durst not returne, and so remained in this Country, where they enjoyed a long freedom,
til by many incursions of piracy, still molesting the Venetians they lost many of
their Townes Anno 938. &amp; afterward the whole Country made tributary by Duke Henry
Gondolo about the yeare 1200.
</p>
<p>That part which bordereth with the sea, belongeth to the Venetians, but the rest within
land holds of the Emperour, and the Archduke of Austria. The Country it selfe aboundeth
in cornes, wines and all kinds of fruites necessary for humane life. Neare to this
haven wherein we lay, expecting roome windes, I saw the ruines <span class="marginnote"><i>Justinopoli decayed.</i></span>of old Justinopoli, so called of Justinian the Emperour, who builded it upon an Iland
of a miles length, and three acres broad: And to passe betwixt the City and the firme
land, there was seven bridges made. It was aunciently strong, but now altogether decayed:
The principall Cities in Istria at this day, are these, Parenzo, Humago, Pola, Rovigo.
</p>
<p>The windes favouring us, we weighed Ankors, and sayled by the Iles Brioni, so much
esteemed, for the fine stones they produce, called Istriennes: which serve to beautifie
the Venetian Palaces. About midday I saw Mount di Caldaro, on the foote of which,
the auncient City of Pola is situated, having a harbour wherein small shippes may
lie. True it is, this Port is not much frequented, in respect of a contageous Lake
neare to it, which infecteth the ayre with a filthy exhalation. I saw hard by this
place, the ruines of the Castell di Oriando, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42">42</a>]</span>the Arke Triumphant, and the reliques of a great Amphitheatre. This Pola was called
by Pliny, Julia pietas; and it standeth in the South-east part of Istria. Continuing
our course, we passed the perillous gulfe of Carnaro.
</p>
<p>This gulfe or bay of Carnaro, runneth in North, and by East 50. miles within land,
at the narrow entry <span class="right-marginnote">[II. 46.]</span>whereof, it hath a part of Istria on the West, and the Dalmatia on the East: The Venetians
use to keepe alwayes certaine Gallies at the mouth of this bay, on the Dalmatian side,
to intercept the cursary of the Scoks: In the bottome of this Carnarian gulfe are
placed Senna, Gradisca, and Novagard, the chiefe Cities of Croatia: the people which
inhabit these Townes, and the adjoyning Countrey are called Scoks, a kind of Dalmatians,
being of a robust nature, courageous and desperate: Their weapons are broad two handed
swords, long Skenes, carrying targets at their girdles, and long Gunnes in their hands:
They are marveilous swift on foote, and dayly annoy by land their neighbouring Turkes
with inrodes, fetching away great spoyles and booties, of <span class="marginnote"><i>The Scoks live under the house of Austria.</i></span>cornes, cattell and horses: And by Sea with Frigots and Brigantines did ever and often
vexe the Venetian commerce, in their owne domesticke waters: The great losses which
from these incursive people the Venetians had from time to time received, and the
other dammages they inflicted upon the Turkes in their trafficking with Venice, for
whom the Venetians are bound by former articles of peace, to keepe harmelesse within
their owne gulfe from all Christian invasions, was the onely and urgent cause that
moved the Venetians to wage warre with Ferdinando then Duke of Grasse, and now Emperour,
Anno Domini, 1616. And besieged Gradisca to their no small disadvantage, both of charges
and losse of men: For the towne being strongly fortified with walles and munition,
and 2000. Scoks within to defend it, would often at the neare approaching of the enemy
make a salley forth on horse and foote, giving many <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43">43</a>]</span>miserable overthrowes to the Assailants: To the which detriments, for twenty dayes
space I was a testator, being after my returne from Affricke in my second travels,
as <span class="right-marginnote">[II. 47.]</span>I was going for Hungary, Moldavia, Valecchia and Transilvania, taking this countrey
in my way: And one morning at the breake of day, I saw 800. Scoks issuing out of towne,
make bloudy havocke of 3000. of the Venetian army: <span class="marginnote"><i>Croatia.</i></span>This part of Croatia is exceeding fertile, abounding in cornes, wines, bestiall and
pastorage, though then by lawlesse, and turbulent souldiers, it was miserable defaced.
</p>
<p>The whole number of these Scoks that are able to carry armes, be not above sixe thousand
men: They are wonderfull kinde to strangers, which to me in no small measure was extended,
and that by the better sort their Captaines and Commanders, and onely for the affinity
of Scoki and Scoti, although I dare sweare, there is little or none at all betwixt
the two Nations.
</p>
<p>Having passed Carnaro, we sayled close by the Ile Sangego, called formerly Illrides:
This Isle is of circuit foure score, and of length thirty miles. Our fresh water waxing
scant, and the winds falling out contrary to our expectation, we sought into Valdogosto
in the Isle of Osero, which is a safe haven for ships and Gallies. This Osero was
first named Asphorus, and then Absirtides, of a Captaine Absertus, who came from Colchis,
accompanied with many people, to bring backe Medea to her carefull father. Whose purpose
being frustrated, stayed still, and inhabited this land. A fit oportunity obtained
upon the <span class="marginnote"><i>Zara nova.</i></span>eighth day, we arrived in the roade of Zara in Dalmatia; for there the Carmoesalo
stayed, and I was exposed to seeke passage for Ragusa.
</p>
<p>By the way, I recall the great kindnesse of that Dalmatian Maister, for offering my
condition, I found him more then courteous, and would have no more but the halfe of
that, which was his bargaine at Venice. Besides <span class="right-marginnote">[II. 48.]</span>this, he also entertained me three dayes, with a most bountifull, and kind acceptance:
My solitary travelling <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44">44</a>]</span>he oft bewailed, wishing me to desist, and never attempt such a voyage; but I giving
him absolute, and constant answers, appeased his imagined sorrow.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Ignorance and Sloth.</i></span>True it is, that ignorance and sloth, make every thing terrible unto us, and we will
not, because we dare not, and dare not, because we will not: This makes us submit
our selves to any thing, that doth either flatter or threaten us: And like some sottish
weakelings, that give the reines of their governement into the hands of their Wives
or Servants, thinking then they buy their peace when they sell it; thus doe they grow
upon us, I meane ignorance and sloth, and by composition, not force, become masters
of the place, being just so strong, as we are weake. And as contrary newes delivered
at one time, maketh one to heare with joy, and remember with sorrow; even so an unresolved
man, in high and heroyicke designes, though seeming forward is distracted here, set
on feare there, and rent asunder every where with the flashing frights of desperation:
But a constant resolution can couragiously support all things; Ubicunque homo est,
ibi beneficio locus est. And congratulating this Skippers courtesie, I bad farewell
to his councell.
</p>
<p>Zara is the capitall city of Dalmatia, called of old, Jadara. The inhabitants are
governed by a Camarlingo, or Chamberlaine, in the behalfe of Venice. The walles whereof
are strongly rampired with earth; surpassing the tops of the stone-worke: and fortified
also with high Bulwarkes, and planted Canons on elevated Rampires of earth: which
are above forty cubites higher then the Walles and Bulwarkes; standing in the foure
severall corners of the city.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[II. 49.]</span>There lye continually in it; a great Garrison of Souldiers to defend the towne and
Citizens, who are maintained by the Duke of Venice: for he is Signior thereof. They
have indured many invasions of the Turkes, especially in the yeare one thousand five
hundreth and seventy, when for the space of fourteene moneths, they were dayly molested
and besieged, but the victory fell ever to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45">45</a>]</span>Christians: If the Turkes could win this place, they might easily commaund the Adriaticall
Seas, in regard of that faire Haven which is there, to receive Ships and Gallies;
which maketh the Venetians not a little fearefull because of their safeguard.
</p>
<p>Yet they licentiate the neighbouring Infidels to traffick with them, but when they
enter the gates, they must deliver their weapons to the Corporall of the Squadron
company: Neither may they stay within all night under the paine of imprisonment. <span class="marginnote"><i>Dalmatia.</i></span>Dalmatia was called so of Mauritius the Emperour. The foure principall Provinces whereof
are these, Atheos, Senebico, Spalleto and Tragurio. A part of which belongeth to Venice,
another part to the arch Duke of Austria, and a third unto the Turkes. Zara is distance
from Venice two hundreth miles.
</p>
<p>When the wandring night was chased from the inferiour Ilands, by the recoursing day,
and the Sunne had imparted his brightnesse to our under neighbours, and our dreames
ready to possesse the Theater of the fancy, the wearisome creatures of the world declining
to their rest; and under shaddow of the pale Lady of the night; even then, from Zara
I imbarked in a small Frigot, bound for Lesina, with five Slavonian Marriners: who
sometimes sailed, &amp; somtimes rowed with Oares: in our way we past by the Ile of Brazza,
which is of no great quantity, but fertile enough <span class="right-marginnote">[II. 50.]</span>for the Inhabitants, and kept by a Gentleman of Venice. It lieth in the mouth of the
gulfe Narento, that divideth Dalmatia from Slavonia: Many fondly conceive that these
two kingdomes are all one, but I hold the contrary opinion, both by experience, and
by auncient Authors: having passed Capo di Costa, which is the beginning of Slavonia,
I saw upon my right hand, a round Rocke of a great height, in forme of a Piramide;
being cognominated by Easterne Mariners, Pomo, aunciently Salyro, for the good Faulcons
that are bred therein. It standeth in the middest of the Gulfe betweene Slavonia and
Italy, and not habitable.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46">46</a>]</span>
</p>
<p>A little beyond that Rocke, I saw the three Iles Tremiti: The chiefest whereof is
called Teucria, but they are vulgarly called the Iles of Diomedes, who was King of
Etolia. They are right opposite to Mount Gargano, now called <span class="marginnote"><i>Mount S. Angelo.</i></span>Saint Angelo, and distant from the maine land of Apulia in Italy about nine miles.
</p>
<p>This Mount Saint Angelo standeth in Apulia, bending in the Sea with a large promontore,
it is in compasse ninety miles? Neare to this Mountaine, was that great battell fought,
betweene Hanniball and the Romanes: the overthrow fell to the Romanes, under the conduct
of Paulus Æmilius, and other Consuls, of whom were slaine fourty two thousand and
seven hundred; And if Hanniball had followed this victory, he had easily that day
subdued the common-wealth of Rome: which made Maharball Captaine of his horse-men
rebuke him thus, Vincere scis Hanniball victoria uti nescis.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Thou canst o&#x2019;recome thy foes in bloody fight,

<p class="first">The like said Cæsar of Pompey, when he lost the first battell they fought at Pharsalia
in Greece; O Pompey, Pompey, If thou hadst knowne how to have used the <span class="right-marginnote">[II. 51.]</span>victory, as thou hadst it, thou mightest have beene this day Lord of the whole World.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>A woful battell.</i></span>So to our lamentable memory, may that last battell be recorded fought in Hungary,
betweene the Turkes and Christians, of whom Maxamilian Duke of Isbrugh this present
Emperours Uncle was Generall: who having had a nocturnall victory, and the Infidels
put to the flight, they remaining in the Campe more busie about the spoyles then their
owne safety; the Turkes returned againe before day, the Christians being disordered
with booties and the ravening of their whores, they put them all to the edge of the
sword: O miserable confusion! Little better might I speake of the battell of Lepanto
being abusd even in the using of it, and that glorious victory no waies followed,
as good fortune had given them an awfull opportunity: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47">47</a>]</span>For Don John of Austria their Generall had a greater mind to seaze upon the Ile of
Corfu, and to robbe Venice of her liberty, then to prosecute with vengeance the brave
beginning of so notable a victory; and yet his treachery was discoverd, and by the
Venetian Generall speedily disappointed, to his eternall shame both wayes.
</p>
<p>The poore Slavonians being fatigated in their hunger-starving Boat, with extraordinary
paines (for we had three daies calme, which is not usually seene in these Seas) were
enforced to repose all night at the barren Ile of St. Andrew: This Ile is of circuite
foure miles, but not inhabited: The excessive raine that fell in the evening, made
us goe on shoare, to seeke the coverture of some rocke; which found, we lay all night
on hard stones, and with hungry bellies: for our provision was spent. The breach of
day giving comfort to our distressed bodies, with favourable windes at the Garbo e
ponente, we set forward, and about midday we arrived in the Port of Lesina, of <span class="right-marginnote">[II. 52.]</span>which the Ile taketh the name.
</p>
<p>This Ile of Lesina is of circuite, a hundred and fifty miles, and is the biggest Iland
in the Adriaticke Sea: It is exceeding fertile, and yeeldeth all things plentifully,
that is requisite for the sustenance of man. The City is unwalled, and of no great
quantity, but they have a strong fortresse, which defendeth the Towne, the Haven,
and the vessels in the Roade. The Governour, who was a Venetian, after he had enquired
of my intended voyage, most courteously invited me three times to his Table, in the
time of my five dayes staying there: And at the last meeting, he reported the story
of a marvellous mis-shapen creature borne in the Iland, asking if I would goe thither
to see it: wherewith (when I perfectly understood the matter) I was contented: The
Gentleman honoured me also with his company, and a horse to ride on, where when we
came, the Captaine called for the father of <span class="marginnote"><i>A Monster borne in Lesina.</i></span>that Monster, to bring him foorth before us. Which unnaturall Childe being brought,
I was amazed in that sight, to behold the deformity of Nature; for below the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48">48</a>]</span>middle part, there was but one body, and above the middle there was two living soules,
each one separated from another with severall members. Their heads were both of one
bignesse but different in Phisnomy: The belly of the one joyned with the posterior
part of the other, and their faces looked both one way, as if the one had carried
the other on his backe, and often before our eyes, he that was behind, would lay his
hands about the necke of the formost. Their eyes were exceeding bigge, and their hands
greater then an Infant of three times their age. The excrements of both creatures
issued foorth at one place, and their thighes and legges of a great growth, not semblable
to their age, being but sixe and thirty dayes <span class="right-marginnote">[II. 53.]</span>old; and their feete were proportionably made like to the foot of a Cammell, round
and cloven in the middest. They received their food with an insatiable desire, and
continually mourned with a pitifull noyse; that sorrowfull man told us, that when
the one slept, the other awaked, which was a strange disagreement in Nature. The Mother
of them bought dearely that birth, with the losse of her owne life; as her Husband
reported, unspeakeable was that torment she indured, in that woefull wrestling paine.
I was also informed afterwards, that this one, or rather twofold wretch lived but
a short while after we saw them.
</p>
<p>Leaving this monstrous shapen Monster to the owne strange, and almost incredulous
Nativity, we returned to Lesiva. But by the way of our backe comming, I remember that
worthy Gentleman who shewed me the ruines of an old house, where the noble <span class="marginnote"><i>Demetrius.</i></span>King Demetrius was borne; and after I had yeelded by bounden and dutifull thankes
unto his generous minde, I hired a Fisher-boate to goe over to Clissa, being twelve
miles distant. This Ile of Clissa is of length twenty, and of circuit threescore miles:
It is beautified with two profitable Sea-ports, and under the Signiory of Venice.
There are indifferent good commodities therein; upon the South side of this Iland
lieth the Ile Pelagusa, a rocky and barren place.
</p>
<p>Departing from thence in a Carmoesalo bound to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49">49</a>]</span>Ragusa, we sailed by the three Iles, Brisca, Placa, Igezi; And when we entred in the
Gulfe of Cataro, we fetched up the sight of the Ile Melida, called of old Meligna:
Before we could attaine unto the Haven, wherein our purpose was to stay all night,
we were assailed on a sudden with a deadly storme: Insomuch, that every swallowing
wave threatned our death, and bred in our breasts, an intermingled sorrowe of feare
and hope. And yet hard <span class="right-marginnote">[II. 54.]</span>by us, and within a mile to the ley-ward, a Barbarian man of war of Tunneis, carrying
two tyre of Ordonance, and 200. men, seaz&#x2019;d upon a Carmosale of Venice, at the first
shot, she being loaden with Malvasie and Muscadine and come from Candy, and had us
also in chase till night divided our contrary designes. The winds becomming favourable,
and our double desired safety enjoyed, both because of the sea storme, and of the
stormy Pyrat, we set forward in the Gulfe of Cataro, and sayled by the <span class="marginnote"><i>Cursola.</i></span>Ile Cursola: in this island I saw a walled towne called Curzola, which hath two strong
Fortresses to guard it. It is both commodious for the trafficke of Merchandize they
have, and also for the fine wood that groweth there, whereof the Venetian Ships and
Gallies are made: An Iland no lesse pleasant then profitable; and the two Governours
thereof are changed every eighteene moneths, by the State of Venice.
</p>
<p>It was of old called Curcura, Melana, and of some Corcira Nigra, but by the Modernes,
Curzola. Continuing our course, we passed by the iles Sabionzello, Torquolla, and
Catza Augusta, appertaining to the Republike of Ragusa. They are all three well inhabited
and fruitfull, yeelding cornes, wines, and certaine rare kinds of excellent fruites.
It is dangerous for great vessels to come neere their coasts, because of the hidden
shelfs that lie off in the sea, called Augustini, where divers ships have beene cast
away in fowle weather; upon the second day after our loosing from Clissa, we arrived
at Ragusa.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Ragusa.</i></span>Ragusa is a Common-weale, governed by Senators, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50">50</a>]</span>a Senate Counsell; it is wonderfull strong, and also well guarded, being situate by
the sea side, it hath a fine Haven, and many goodly ships thereunto belonging: The
greatest trafficke they have, is with the Genueses: Their <span class="right-marginnote">[II. 55.]</span>territory in the firme land is not much in respect of the neighbouring Turkes, but
they have certaine commodious ilands, which to them are profitable: And notwithstanding,
of the great strength and riches they possesse, yet for their better safeguard and
liberty, they pay a yearly tributary pension unto the great Turke, amounting to fourteene
thousand Chickens of Gold: yea, and also they pay yearely a tributary pension unto
the Venetians, for the Iles reserved by them in the Adriaticall Gulfe, so that both
by sea and land they are made tributary citizens. The most part of the civill Magistrates,
have but the halfe of their heads bare, but the vulger sort are all shaven like to
the Turkes.
</p>
<p>This Citty is the Metropolitan of the Kingdome of <span class="marginnote"><i>Slavonia.</i></span>Slavonia: Slavonia was first called Liburnia, next, Illiria, of Ilirio the sonne of
Cadmus: But lastly, named Slavonia, of certaine slaves that came from Sarmatia passing
the river Danubio, in the time of the Emperour Justinian: Croatia lying North-west
from hence, is the third Province of this auntient Ilyria, and was formerly called
Valeria, or Corvatia: It hath on the West Istria and Carniola: on the East and South,
Dalmatia: on the North North-west a part of Carindia quasi Carinthia, and northerly
Savus: So much as is called Slavonia, extendeth from the River Arsa in the West, the
river Drino in the East, on the South bordereth with the Gulfe of Venice, and on the
North with the Mountaines of Croatia: These Mountaines divide also Ragusa from Bosna.
Bosna is bounded on the West with Croatia, and on the South with Illiricum, or Slavonia,
on the East with Servia: and on the North with the River Savus.
</p>
<p>The next two speciall Citties in that Kingdome, are Sabenica and Salona. The Slavonians
are of a robust <span class="right-marginnote">[II. 56.]</span>nature, martiall, and marvellous valiant fellowes, and a great helpe to maintaine
the right and liberty of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51">51</a>]</span>Venetian State, serving them both by sea and land, and specially upon their Galleyes
and men of Warre. From Ragusa I imbarked in a Tartareta, loaden with corne, and bound
to Corfu, being three hundred miles distant.
</p>
<p>In all this way we found no Iland, but sayled along the maine land of the Illirian
shoare: having passed the Gulfe of Cataro, and Capo di Fortuna, I saw Castello novo:
which is a strong Fortresse, situate on the top of a Rocke: wherein one Barbarisso,
the Captaine of Solyman, <span class="marginnote">4000. <i>Spaniards starvd to death.</i></span>starved to death foure thousand Spaniards. Having left Illiria Albania, and Valona
behind us, we sayled by Capo di Palone, the large promontore of which, extendeth to
eight miles in length, being the face of a square and maine Rocke. This high land
is the furthest part of the Gulfe of Venice, and opposite against Capo di Sancta Maria
in Apulia, each one in sight of another, and fourteene leagues distant. Continuing
our Navigation, we entred into the Sea Ionium, and sayled along the coast of Epire,
which was the famous Kingdome of the Epirotes, and the first beginning of Greece.
Epirus is environed on the South with the sea Ionian: on the East with Macedon; On
the West North west, with Albania; and on the North, with a part of Rascia, and the
huge Hill Hæmus: Of which Mountaine Stratonicus was wont to say, that for eight moneths
in the yeare, it was exceeding cold, and for the other foure, it was Winter: This
long Mountaine devideth also Greece from Mysia, called vulgarly Bulgaria, lying on
the North of Hæmus, and to the South of Danubio, even Eastward to the Euxine sea:
Which River parteth also Dacia, from Mysia the superiour, the which Dacia being an
auncient and famous countrey, <span class="right-marginnote">[II. 57.]</span>containeth these Provinces, Transilvania, Moldavia, Vallachia, Servia, and Bosna:
Here in this Kingdome of Epyre, was the noble and valiant Pirhus King, who made so
great warres upon the Romanes, and at last by a woman of Argos was killed with a stone:
The most valerous Captaine George Castriot surnamed <span class="marginnote"><i>Scanderberg.</i></span>Scanderberg, the great terrour and scourge unto the Turkes was borne here; of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52">52</a>]</span>whom it is recorded, he slew at diverse battels with his owne hands, above three thousand
Turkes; obtaining also many fortunate victories against Amurath and Mahomet: After
whose death and buriall, his body was digged up by the Turkes, and joyfull was that
man could get the least bit of his bones to preserve, and carry about with him, thinking
thereby so long as he kept it, he should alwayes be invincible, which the Turkes observe
to this day, and likely to do it to their last day. And more,

<p class="first">In this countrey are these two Rivers, Acheron and Cocytus; who for their minerall
colours, and bitter tasts, were surnamed the Rivers of Hell; and the sacred Mount
Pindus, celebrate to Apollo and the Muses so well memorized by Poets, is here. It
is now called Mezzona, at the foote of which springeth the River of Peneia, called
Modernely Salepiros, but more properly Azababa, and keeping his extreamest course
through the fields of pleasure, named by the auncients Tempi, being five miles long,
and as much large, lying betweene the two Hils Osso and Olympus, and watering that
beautiful plaine, the faire Peneian spring, or Azababan River, disburdeneth it selfe
in the gulfe Thessalonick. This is the first kingdom of Greece, and of a great length
consisting betweene <span class="right-marginnote">[II. 58.]</span>the West, most part of Albania, as a perpendicular Province annexed to it, and the
Arcadian Alpes, which divide Ætolia and Acarnania, the East-most regions of it, from
Sparta, Thessaly, and the old Mirmidons Countrey of Macedon, amounteth to foure hundred
and eight miles, lying along by the Sea side, whose breadth extendeth all the way
along Northward to the hill Hæmus, above 68. miles. The chiefe Towne of Epyre, where
the Kings had their residence, was called Ambracia, modernely Laerto named of a river
running by it: And upon the sixt day after our departure from Ragusa, we arrived at
Corfu.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The Ile Corfu.</i></span>Corfu is an Iland, no lesse beautifull, then invincible: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53">53</a>]</span>It lieth in the Sea Ionean, the Inhabitants are Greekes, and the Governours Venetians:
This Ile was much honoured by Homer, for the pleasant Gardens of Alcino, which were
in his time. This Alcino was that Corcyrian Poet, who so benignely received Ulysses
after his shipwracke, and of whom Ovid said.

</div>
<p class="first">This Ile was given to the Venetians by the Corsicans, Anno. 1382. because they were
exposed to all the injuries of the world: It lieth like to a halfe moone, or halfe
a circle East and North: The Easterne Cape is called Leuchino, the other Northward,
St. Katerina; the second Towne whereof is called Pagleopoli: It is of circuite one
hundred and twenty, in length fifty two, and thirty seaven in breadth, and foureteene
miles distant from Epyre. The City Corfu, from which the Ile hath the name, is situate
at the foote of a Mountaine, whereupon are builded two <span class="right-marginnote">[II. 59.]</span>strong Fortresses, and invironed with a naturall Rocke: The one is called Fortezza
Nova and the other Fortezza vecchia: They are well governed, and circumspectly kept,
least by the instigation of the one Captaine, the other should commit any treasonable
effect: And for the same purpose, the Governours of both Castles, at their election
before the Senatours of Venice are sworne; neither privately, nor openly to have mutuall
conference; nor to write one to another, for the space of two yeares, which is the
time of their government. These Castles are inaccessable, and unconquerable, if that
the Keepers be loyall, and provided with naturall and martiall furniture. They are
vulgarly called, <span class="marginnote"><i>Two strong Castles.</i></span>The Forts of Christendome, by the Greekes; but more justly, The strength of Venice:
for if these Castles were taken by the Turkes, or by the Spanyard who would as gladly
have them, the trade of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54">54</a>]</span>the Venetian Merchants would be of none account; yea the very meane to overthrow Venice
it selfe.
</p>
<p>Corfu formerly Corcyra. was by some called Phæacia, so denominate from a Virgin of
that name, who was here supposed to have beene deflowred by Neptune. This Ile produceth
good store of Wines, Oyle, Wax, Honey, and delicate fruits.
</p>
<p>From thence after certaine daies abode, I imbarked in a Greekish Carmesalo, with a
great number of passengers, Greekes, Slavonians, Italians, Armenians, and Jewes, that
were all mindefull to Zante, and I also of the like intent; being in all fourty eight
persons: having roome windes, and a fresh gale, in 24. houres we discovered the Ile
Cephalonia the greater; and sayled close along Cephalonia minor, or the lesser Ithaca,
called now Val di Compare, being in length twenty, and in circuite fifty sixe miles,
renowned for the birth of Laertes sonne, Ulysses;

<p class="first">On our left hand toward the maine, we saw an Iland, called Saint Maure, formerly Leucas,
or Leucada; which is onely inhabited by Jewes, to whome Bajazet the second gave it
in possession, after their expulsion from Spaine: The chiefe City is Saint Maure,
which not long agoe was subject to Venice. This Ile Saint Maure was aunciently contiguate
with the continent, but now rent asunder, and invironed with the sea: In this meane
while of our navigable passage, the Captaine of the vessell espied a Saile comming
from Sea, he presently being moved therewith, sent a Mariner to the toppe, who certified
him she was a Turkish Galley of Biserta, prosecuting a straight course to invade our
Barke. Which sudden affrighting newes overwhelmed us almost in despare. Resolution
being by the amazed Maister demaunded, of every man what was best to doe, some replyed
one way, and some <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55">55</a>]</span>another: Insomuch, that the most part of the passengers gave counsell, rather to render,
then fight; being confident, their friends would pay their ransome, and so relieve
them. But I the wandring Pilgrime, pondering in my pensive breast, my solitary estate,
the distance of my Country and friends, could conceive no hope of deliverance. Upon
the which troublesome and fearefull appearance of slavery, <span class="marginnote"><i>A counsell to fight.</i></span>I absolutely arose, and spoke to the Maister, saying: The halfe of the Carmosalo is
your owne, and the most part also of the loading (all which he had told me before:)
wherefore my counsell is, that you prepare your selfe to fight, and goe encourage
your passengers, promise to your Mariners double wages, make ready your two peeces
of <span class="right-marginnote">[II. 61.]</span>Ordonance, your Muskets, Powder, Lead and halfe-Pikes: for who knoweth, but the Lord
may deliver us from the thraldome of these Infidels, My exhortation ended, he was
greatly animated therewith, and gave me thankes; whereupon, assembling the passengers
and Mariners, he gave good comfort, and large promises to them all: So that their
affrighted hopes were converted to a couragious resolution; seeming rather to give
the first assault, then to receive the second wrong.
</p>
<p>To performe the plots of our defence, every man was busie in the worke, some below
in the Gunner-roome, others cleansing the Muskets, some preparing the powder and balles,
some their Swords, and short weapons, some dressing the halfe-pikes, &amp; others making
fast the doores above: for so the Maister resolved to make combate below, both to
save us from small shot, and besides for boording us on a sudden. The dexterous courage
of all men was so forward to defend their lives and liberty, that truely in mine opinion
we seemed thrice as many as we were. All things below and above being cunningly perfected,
and every one ranked in order with his Harquebuse and pike, to stand on the Centinell
of his owne defence, we recommended our selves in the hands of the Almighty: and in
the meane while attended their fiery salutations.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56">56</a>]</span>
</p>
<p>In a furious spleene, the first Hola of their courtesies, was the progresse of a martiall
conflict, thundring forth a terrible noise of Galley-roaring peeces. And we in a sad
reply, sent out a backe-sounding eccho of fiery flying shots: which made an æquivox
to the clouds, rebounding backward in our perturbed breasts, the ambiguous sounds
of feare and hope. After a long and doubtfull fight, both with great and small shot
(night parting us) the Turkes <span class="right-marginnote">[II. 62.]</span>retired till morning, and then were mindfull to give us the new rancounter of a second
alarum. But as it pleased him, who never faileth his, to send downe an unresistable
tempest; about the breake of day we escaped their furious designes; and were enforced
to seeke into the bay of Largostolo in Cephalonia; both because of the violent weather,
and also for that a great lake was stricken into our Ship. In this fight there were
of us killed three Italians, two Greekes, and two Jewes, with eleven others deadly
wounded, and I also hurt in the right arme with <span class="marginnote"><i>A notable deliverance.</i></span>a small shot. But what harme was done by us amongst the Infidels, we were not assured
thereof, save onely this, we shot away their middle mast, and the hinder part of the
puppe; for the Greekes are not expert Gunners, neither could our Harquebusadoes much
annoy them, in respect they never boorded. But howsoever it was, being all disbarked
on shoare, we gave thanks to the Lord for our unexpected safety, and buried the dead
Christians in a Greekish Church-yard, and the Jewes were interred by the sea side.
</p>
<p>This bay of Largastolo is two miles in length, being invironed with two little Mountaines;
upon the one of these two, standeth a strong Fortresse, which defendeth the passage
of the narrow Gulfe. It was here that the Christian Gallies assembled, in the yeare
1571. when they came to abate the rage of the great Turks Armado; which at that time
lay in Peterasso, in the firme land of Greece, and right opposite to them; and had
made conquest the yeare before, of noble Cyprus from the Venetians.
</p>
<p>The Ile of Cephalonia was formerly called Ithaca, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57">57</a>]</span>greatly renowned, because it was the heretable Kingdome of the worthy Ulysses, who
excelled all other Greekes in Eloquence and subtility of wit. Secondly, by Strabo
it was named Dulichi: And thirdly, by auncient Authors <span class="right-marginnote">[II. 63.]</span><span class="marginnote"><i>Cephalonia of old Ithaca.</i></span>Cephalonia, of Cephalo, who was Captaine of the Army of Cleobas Anfrittion. The which
Anfrittion, a Theban Captaine having conquered the Iland, and slaine in battell Pterelaus
King of Teleboas, for so then was the Iland called, gave it in a gift of government
to Cephalo. This Cephalo was a Noble man of Athens, who being one day at hunting killed
his owne wife Procris, with an arrow in steed of his prey, whereupon he flying to
Amphitrion, and the other pittying his case, resigned this Islle to him, of whom it
taketh the denomination: Cephalonia lyeth in the mouth of the Gulfe Lepanto, opposite
to a part of Ætolia and Acarnania in the firme land: It is in circuit 156. and in
length 48. miles.
</p>
<p>The land it selfe is full of Mountaines, yet exceeding fertile, yeelding Malvasia,
Muskadine, vino Leatico, Raysins, Olives, Figges, Honey, Sweet-water, Pine, Mol-berry,
Date, and Cypre-trees, and all other sorts of fruites in abundance. The commodity
of which redounds yearely to the Venetians, for they are Signiors thereof.
</p>
<p>Leaving this weather-beaten Carmoesalo, layd up to a full sea, I tooke purpose to
travell through the Iland; in the first dayes journey, I past by many fine Villages
and pleasant fields, especially the vaile Alessandro; where the Greekes told me, their
Ancestors were vanquished in battell by the Macedonian Conquerour. They also shewed
me on the top of Mount Gargasso, the ruines of that Temple, which had beene of old
dedicate to Jupiter: and upon the second day I hired two Fisher-men in a little Boat,
to carry me over to Zante, being twenty five miles distant.
</p>
<p>Here in Zante a Greekish Chyrurgion undertooke the curing of my arme, &amp; performed
condition within time.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[II. 64.]</span><span class="marginnote"><i>Zante.</i></span>The Ile of Zante was called Zacinthus, because so was called the sonne of Dardanus,
who reigned there. And <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58">58</a>]</span>by some Hyria. It hath a Citty of a great length, bordering along the sea side, the
chiefe seate of the Ile, &amp; named Zante, over the doore of whose Prætorium or Judgement
Hall, are inscribed these verses,
</p>
<div class="lgouter">

<p class="first">And on the top of a Hill, above the towne, standeth a large, and strong Fortresse
(not unlike the Castle of Milaine) wherein the Providitore dwelleth, who governeth
the Iland. This Citty is subject yearely to fearefull Earthquakes, especially in the
moneths of October and November, which oftentimes subvert their houses, and themselves,
bringing deadly destruction on all. This Ile produceth good store of Rasini di Corintho,
commonly called Currants, Olives, Pomgranates, Cytrones, Orenges, Lemmons, Grenadiers,
and Mellones, and is in compasse 68. miles, being distant from the fore Promontore
of Morea some 16. miles.
</p>
<p>The Ilanders are Greekes, a kind of subtile people, and great dissemblers; but the
Signiory thereof belongeth to Venice. And if it were not for that great provision
of corne, which are dayly transported from the firme land of Peleponesus to them,
the Inhabitants in short time would famish.
</p>
<p>It was credibly told me here by the better sort, that this little Ile maketh yearely
(besides Oyle and Wine) onely of Currants 160000. Chickins, paying yearely over and
above for custome 22000. Piasters, every Chicken <span class="right-marginnote">[II. 65.]</span>of Gold being nine shillings English, and every Piaster being white money sixe shillings.
A rent or summe of mony which these silly Ilanders could never affoord, (they being
not above 60. yeares agoe, but a base beggarly people, and an obscure place) if it
were not here in England of late for some Liquorous lips, who forsooth can hardly
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59">59</a>]</span>digest Bread, Pasties, Broth; and (verbi gratia) bag-puddings without these curraunts:
And as these Rascall Greekes becomming proud of late with this levish expence, contemne
justly this sensuall prodigality; I have heard them often demaund the English in a
filthy derision, what they did with such Leprous stuffe, and if they carried them
home to feed their Swine and Hogges withall: A question indeed worthy of such a female
Traffike, the inference of which I suspend: There is no other Nation save this, thus
addicted to that miserable Ile.
</p>
<p>Bidding farewell to Zante, I imbarked in a Frigato, going to Peterasso in Morea, which
of old was called Peloponesus: And by the way in the Gulfe Lepanto (which divideth
Etolia and Morea. The chiefest Citty in Etolia is called Lepanto: from thence West-ward
by the sea side, is Delphos, famous for the Oracle of Apollo) we sayled by the Iles
Echinidi, but by Moderne Writers, Curzolari: where the Christians obtained the victory
against the Turkes, for there did they fight, after this manner.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Christian Generalls.</i></span>In the yeare 1571. and the sixth of October, Don John of Austria, Generall for the
Spanish Gallies, Marco Antonio Colonna, for Pope Pio Quinto; and Sebastiano Venieco
for the Venetian Army, convened altogether in Largostolo at Cephalonia: having of
all 208. Gallies, sixe Galleasses, and 25. Frigotes.
</p>
<p>After a most resolute deliberation, these three Generals went with a valiant courage
to incounter with the Turkish <span class="right-marginnote">[II. 66.]</span>Armado, on the Sunday morning, the seventh of October: who in the end, through the
helpe of Christ, obtained a <span class="marginnote"><i>The battell of Lepanto.</i></span>glorious victory. In that fight there was taken and drowned 180. of Turkish Gallies;
and there escaped about the number of sixe hundred and fifty shippes, Gallies, Galeotes,
and other vessels: There was fifteene thousand Turkes killed and foure thousand taken
prisoners, besides 4000. peeces of Ordonance, and twelve thousand Christians delivered
from their slavish bondage. In all, the Christians loosed but eleven Gallies, and
five thousand <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60">60</a>]</span>slaine. At their returne to Largostolo, after this victorious battell, the three Generals
divided innumerable spoyles, to their well-deserving Captaines, and worthy Souldiers.
</p>
<p>And notwithstanding Don John led that Armado, yet ambition led him, who in the midst
of that famous victory, conceaved a treacherous designe, to seaze upon the castles
of Corfu, under shew of the Venetian colors, which being discoverd, and he disappointed,
died for displeasure in his returne to Messina in Sicilia; where there his Statue
standeth to this day.

<p>After my arrivall in Peterasso, the Metropolitan of Peloponesus, I left the turmoyling
dangers of the intricated Iles, of the Ionean and Adriaticall seas, and advised to
travell in the firme land of Greece, with a Caravan of Greekes that was bound for
Athens.
</p>
<p>Peterasso is a large and spacious City, full of Merchandize, and greatly beautified
with all kind of Commercers, Their chiefe commodities, are raw Silkes, Cloth of gold
and silver, Silken-growgranes, Rich-damas, Velvets of all kinds, with Sattins and
Taffeties, and especially a Girnell for grayne: The Venetians, Ragusans, and Marseillians
have great handling with them: Here I remember there was an English Factor lying,
whom the Subbassa <span class="right-marginnote">[II. 67.]</span>or Governour of the Towne a Turke, caused privately afterward upon malice to be poysoned,
even when I was wintering at Constantinople, for whose death the worthy and generous
Ambassadour, Sir Thomas Glover my Patrone and Protector, was so highly incensed, that
he went hither himselfe to Peterasso, with two Jannizaries, and a warrant sent with
him from the Emperour, who in the midst of the market-place of Peterasso, caused one
of these two Janizaries, strike off the head from the shoulders of that Sanzack; and
put to death divers others also that had beene accessary to the poysoning of the English
Consul; and the Ambassadour returning againe to Constantinople, was held in singular
reputation even with the Turkes, for prosecuting so powerfully the course <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61">61</a>]</span>of Justice, and would not shrinke for no respect, I being domestick with him the selfe
same time.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Morea in Greece.</i></span>Peloponnesus now called Morea, a Peninsula, is all invironed with the sea, save onely
at a narrow strait, where it is tied to the continent by an Istmus of five miles in
breadth: which the Venetians then Lord of it, fortified with five Castles, and a strong
wall from creeke to creeke, which easily were subverted by the Turkish batteries,
the defect onely remaining in the defendants weaknesse, and want of men: Corinth and
its gulfe, lyeth at the East end of this Istmus, and the gulfe Lepanto on the West,
dividing Ætolia and Epyre: The wall which traversed this strait of Morea, was called
Hexamite, five miles long: Truely it is one of the most famous distroit du terre en
Europe. Morea it selfe is in length 168. and in compasse 546. miles, and is at this
day, the most fertile, and best inhabited Province of all the Empyre of Greece: The
chiefe Rivers here, are Arbona and Ropheos: Argos here also is watered with the River
Planizza, neare which <span class="right-marginnote">[II. 68.]</span>standeth the Towne of Epidaure, wherein the Temple of Esculapius was so renowned for
restoring of health to diseased persons. It was anciently cognominate Agalia from
Agalius the first King, Anno Mundi 1574. and also intituled from two Kings Sicionia,
and Apia, then Peloponesus from Pelops, and now Moreah. It is divided in five territories
or petty Provinces, Laconia, Arcadia, Argolis, Misenia, and Eliso, the proper territory
of Corinth. Of which City it was sayd,
</p>
<div class="lgouter">

<p class="line xd29e1095">Who earn&#x2019;d ten thousand Drachmas in an houre.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">It is sayd by Æneas Silvius in his Cosmographicall treatise of Europe that divers
Kings went about to digge <span class="marginnote"><i>The strait of Morea.</i></span>through this Istmus to make it an Iland, namely King Demetrius, Julius Cæsar, Caius
Caligula, and Domitius Nero: Of all whome he doth note that they not onely failed
of their purpose, but that they came to violent and unnaturall deaths.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62">62</a>]</span>
</p>
<p>But before the aforesayd Caravan at Peterasso admitted me into his company, he was
wonderfull inquisitive, to know for what cause I travelled alone? &amp; of what Nation
I was? To whom I soberly excused, and discovered my selfe with modest answers. Which
pacified his curiosity; but not his avaritious minde: for under a pretended protection
he had of me, he extorted the most part of my money from my purse, without any regard
of conscience.
</p>
<p>In the first, second, and third dayes journeying, we had faire way, hard lodging,
but good cheere, and kind entertainement for our money, which was the Countrey Laconia.
But on the fourth day, when we entred in the hilly and barren Countrey of Arcadia;
where, for a dayes journey we had no Village, but saw abundance of Cattell <span class="right-marginnote">[II. 69.]</span>without keepers; and in that place it is thought the great battell of Pharsalia was
fought betweene Julius Cæsar, and Pompey the great.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Arcadia.</i></span>Arcadia is bounded on the East with Eliso, on the West with Misenia, on the North
with Achaia inferiour, and on the South with a part of Laconia and the sea: It was
formerly termed Pelasgia, and lastly it tooke the name from Arcas the sonne of Jupiter
and Calisto, the people whereof, did long imagine they were more auncient then the
Moone;
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">This soyle of whom Arcas great patrone was,
</p>
<p class="line">In age the Moone excell&#x2019;d, in wit the Asse.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">But because it is a tradition of more antiquity then credit, I doe rather note it,
then affirme it: And as men should dread the thunder-bolt, when they see the lightning,
so ignorance and idolatry placed amongst us, and round about us, may be a warning
to the professours of the trueth, to take heed of the venome, least by their Arcadian
antiquitie surpassing the Moone, they become novices to some new intended massacre,
for as powder faild them, but alas, not poison! so now with policy they prevaile in
all things: how long the holy one of Israell knoweth, but <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63">63</a>]</span>certainely, our sinnes are the causes of their domineering and of our carelesse drouping.
</p>
<p>In this Desart way, I beheld many singular Monuments, and ruinous Castles, whose names
I knew not, because I had an ignorant guide: But this I remember, amongst these rockes
my belly was pinched, and wearied was my body, with the climbing of fastidious mountaines,
which bred no small griefe to my breast. Yet notwithstanding of my distresse, the
rememberance of these sweet seasoned Songs of Arcadian Sheepheards which pregnant
Poets have so well penned, did recreate my fatigated corps with <span class="right-marginnote">[II. 70.]</span>many sugred suppositions. These sterile bounds being past, we entred in the Easterne
plaine of Morea, called aunciently Sparta, where that sometimes famous Citty of Lacedemon
flourished, but now sacked, and the lumpes of ruines and memory onely remaines. Marching
thus, we left Modena and Napoli on our right hand, toward the sea side, and on the
sixt day at night, we pitched our tents in the disinhabited villages of Argo and Micene,
from the which unhappy Helen was ravished.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The rapt of <span class="corr" id="xd29e2172" title="Source: Hellen">Helen</span>.</i></span>This cursed custome of base prostitution, is become so frequent, that the greater

<p class="first">In all this countrey of Greece I could finde nothing, <span class="right-marginnote">[II. 72.]</span>to answer the famous relations, given by auncient Authors, of the excellency of that
land, but the name onely; the barbarousnesse of Turkes and Time, having defaced all
the Monuments of Antiquity: No shew or honour, no habitation of men in an honest fashion,
nor possessours of the Countrey in a Principality. But rather prisoners shut up in
prisons, or addicted slaves to cruell and tyrannicall Maisters: So deformed is the
state of that once worthy Realme, and so miserable is the burthen of that afflicted
people: which, and the apparance of that permanency, grieved my heart to behold the
sinister working of blind Fortune, which alwayes plungeth the most renowned Champions,
and their memory, in the profoundest pit of all extremities and oblivion.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Greeke Champions.</i></span>Let the Ghosts of that Theban Epaminondas, that Mirmidonian Phillip, &amp; these Epirean
worthies, Pyrhus and Scanderberg, be witnesses hereto; but especially, that Macedonian
Alexander, whose fortunes ever followed him, rather than fled him til his last dissolution;
wherein I may say his greatnesse rose; Like to a mighty and huge Oke, being cled with
the exuvials, and Trophees of enemies fenced with an army of boughes garnished with
a coat of barke as hard as Steele; despising the force and power of the Winds, as
being onely able to dally with the leaves, and not to weaken the roote: But the Northerne
wind, that strong Champion of the airy Region, secretly lurking in the vault of some
hollow cloude, doth first murmure at this aspiring Oke, and then striketh his Crest
with some greater strength; and lastly, with the deepest breath of his Lungs, doth
blow up the roote: Even so was it with Alexander, who from a stripling came to be
a Cedar, and from the sorrow of no more worlds, was soone cut off from the world he
was into: For destiny <span class="right-marginnote">[II. 73.]</span>is no mans drudge, and death is every mans conquerour, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66">66</a>]</span>matching the Scepter, with the Spade, and the crowned Prince with the praislesse Peasant:
And in a word, there was never any to whom fortune did sooner approach, nor never
any from whom she did more suddenly flee, then from Alexander, leaving him a cleare
mirrour of the worlds inconstancy.
</p>
<p>Now as concerning the government of Greece, tearmd by the Turkes, Rum Ili, that is,
the Romane Country: <span class="marginnote"><i>The Beglerbeg of Greece.</i></span>It is ruled by a Beglerbeg, or Bassa, this word Beglerbeg imports, Lord of Lords,
in regard of the Sanzacks, or Subbassaes under them, who also are tearmed Lords; which
is a barbarous pride in an ambitious style: This Beglerbeg of Greece, retaineth his
residence at Sophia the Metropole of Bulgaria, formerly Dacia, and is the greatest
Commaunder of all other Bassaes in the Turkish Provinces of Europe.
</p>
<p>All other Beglerbegs are changed every third yeare, or continued according to the
Imperiall pleasure, neither may they returne from their station during this time.
But this Bassa of Greece, keepeth his government for his life-time, and remaineth
most at Court: He reserveth under his commaund, fourty thousand Timariots or Horsemen;
led under the conduct of twenty two Sanzacks, or Judges deputies of Jurisdictions;
to wit, two in Albania, at the Townes Iscodera, and Ancolina: two in Achaia, at Delvina,
and Albassan: three in Thessalia, at Priasim, Salonica, and Trichola: two in Sparta,
at Misietra and Paleopatra: three in Macedonia, at Carmona, Selistria, and Giastandila:
one in Moldavia, at Acheranma: in Bulgaria, one at Sophia: in Thracia, one at Viazza:
in <span class="right-marginnote">[II. 74.]</span>Epyre, one at Ducagina: in Ætolia, one at Joanina: in Peleponesus, one at Peterasso:
the rest are Usopia, Nycopolis, Corinth, and Bandera towards the black-sea, and to
the Northward of Danubio, at his kissing the Euxine waves: This much for the Beglerbeg
ship of Greece, and the Provinces thereunto adjoyning.
</p>
<p>Departing from Argos, upon the seventh day we arrived at <span class="marginnote"><i>Athens.</i></span>Athens: Athens is still inhabited, standing in the East <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67">67</a>]</span>part of Peloponnesus, neere to the frontiers of Macedon, or Thessaly by the Sea side.
It was first called Cecropia: Of one Cecrops the first King thereof, who first founded
it, Anno Mundi, 2409. it was after mightily inlarged by Theseus, and well provided
with good lawes by Solon, and lastly Athens of Minerva: In whose honour for a long
time were celebrate solemne playes, called Panathanaia: Athens is now termed Salenos,
and was once the shrill sounding Trumpet of Mars, yeelding more valiant Captaines
and Commanders then any City in the World, Rome excepted: It was a custome here, that
when any man was growne too wealthy or potent, he was banished thence for ten yeares:
This exile was intituled Ostracisme, because his name who was abandoned was written
in an Oyster-shell: Great combustions and mutinies have happened betweene Lacedemon,
and Athens; at last it was sacked by Lysander, and her Virgin body prostituted to
the lust of 30. insulting Tyrants; not long after whose expulsion, it was utterly
subdued by the Macedonians.
</p>
<p>And in a word Athens being stayned with intestine blood-sheds, and grievously discontented
with the death of her children; her babes were brought forth, for the sword to glut
upon, the bodies of her auncients were made as Pavements to walke upon, her matrones
became a prey and prise to every Ravisher, and her Priests and <span class="right-marginnote">[II. 75.]</span>Sacrificers were slaine before the gates of their Temples.
</p>
<p>This City was the Mother &amp; Well-spring of all liberall Arts and Sciences; and the
great Cisterne of Europe, whence flowed so many Conduit pipes of learning all where,
but now altogether decayed: The circuit of old Athens hath beene according to the
fundamentall walles yet extant about sixe Italian miles, but now of no great quantity,
nor many dwelling houses therein; being within two hundreth fire houses, having a
Castle which formerly was the Temple of Minerva. They have abundance of all things,
requisite for the sustenance of humane life, of which I had no small proofe: For these
Athenians or Greekes, exceeding kindly banqueted me foure dayes, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68">68</a>]</span>furnish&#x2019;t me with necessary provision for my voyage to Creta. And also transported
me by sea in a Brigandine freely, and on their owne charges to Serigo, being 44. miles
distant.
</p>
<p>After my redounded thankes, they having returned, the contemplation on their courtesies,
brought me in rememberance, how curious the old Athenians were to heare of forraine
newes, &amp; with what great regard &amp; estimation they honoured travellers, of which as
yet, they are no wayes defective.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Serigo.</i></span>Serigo is an Iland in the sea Cretico: It was aunciently called Cytherea, of Cithero
the sonne of Phænise: And of Aristotle Porphyris, or Schotera, in respect of the fine
Marble that is got there: It is of circuit threescore miles having but one Castle
called Capsallo, which is kept by a Venetian Captaine: here it is sayd that Venus
did first inhabit, and I saw the ruines of her demolished Temple, on the side of a
mountaine yet extant.
</p>
<p>A little more downeward below this old adored Temple <span class="right-marginnote">[II. 76.]</span>of Venus, are the relickes of that Palace, wherein Menalaus did dwell, who was King
of Sparta, and Lord of this Ile. The Greekes of the Ile told me there were wild Asses
there, who had a stone in their heads, which was a soveraigne remedy for the Falling
sicknesse, and good to make a woman be quickly delivered of her birth. I made afterward
deeper enquiry for it, to have either seene or bought it, but for my life I could
never attaine to any perfect knowledge thereof.
</p>
<p>In the time of my abode, at the Village of Capsalo (being a haven for small barkes,
and situate below the Castle) the Captaine of that same Fortresse <span class="marginnote"><i>A Priest slaine in a Bordell.</i></span>kild a Seminary Priest, whom he had found in the night with his whoore in a Brothel-house:
for the which sacrilegious murther, the Governour of the Ile deposed the Captaine,
and banished him, causing a boate to be prepared to send him to Creta. O! if all the
Priests which doe commit incest, adultery, and fornication (yea, and worse, Il peccato
carnale contra natura) were thus handled and severely rewarded; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69">69</a>]</span>what a sea of Sodomiticall irreligious blood would overflow the halfe of Europe, to
staine the spotted colour of that Romane Beast. Truely, and yet more, these lascivious
Friars are the very Epicures, or off-scourings of the earth; for how oft have I heard
them say one to another? Allegre, allegre, mio caro fratello, chi ben mangia, ben
beve, &amp;c. That is, Be cheerefull, be cheerefull, deare brother, he that eateth well,
drinketh well, he that drinketh well, sleepeth well, he that sleepeth well, sinneth
not, and he that sinneth not, goeth straight through Purgatory to Paradize. This is
all the care of their living, making their tongues to utter what their hearts do thus
prophanely thinke, Ede, bibe, dormi, post mortem nulla voluptas, and as it is well
observed of this monachall and licentious life:

Isoletta of Serigota: Leaving Capo di Spada on our left hand, we arrived at Carabusa
with extreme fortune, being fiercely persued by three Turkish Galleots. Betweene Serigo
and Carabusa we had seven score and twelve miles of dangerous and combustious seas.

the sea Ionian; to the South the Libique sea, and to the East, the Carpathian sea:
It lieth midway twixt Achaia <span class="right-marginnote">[III. 78.]</span>in Greece and Cyrene in Affrick, not being distant from the one, nor from the other,
above two dayes sayling: It is a most famous and auncient Kingdome: By moderne Writers,
it is called Queene of <span class="marginnote"><i>The antiquity of Candy.</i></span>the Iles Mediterrene: It had of olde an hundreth Citties, whereof it had the name
Hecatompolis, but now onely foure, Candia, Canea, Rethimos, and Scythia, the rest
are but Villages and Bourges. It is of length, to wit, from Capo Ermico in the West,
called by Pliny, Frons arietis, and Capo Salomone in the East, two hundreth and forty
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71">71</a>]</span>Miles, large threescore, and of circuit sixe hundreth and fifty miles.
</p>
<p>This is the chiefe Dominion, belonging to the Venetian Reipublique: In every one of
these foure Citties, there is a Governour, and two Counsellors, sent from Venice every
two yeares. The Countrey is divided into foure parts, under the jurisdiction of the
foure Citties, for the better administration of Justice: and they have a Generall,
who commonly remaineth in the Citty of Candy (like to a Viceroy) who deposeth, or
imposeth Magistrates, Captaines, Souldiers, Officers, and others whatsoever, in the
behalfe of Saint Marke or Duke of Venice. The Venetians detaine continually a strong
guard, divided in Companies, Squadrons, and Garrisons, in the Citties and Fortresses
of the Iland: which do extend to the number of 12000. Souldiers, kept, not onely for
the incursion of Turks, but also for feare of the Creets or Inhabitants, who would
rather (if they could) render to the Turke, then to live under the subjection of Venice,
thinking thereby to have more liberty, &amp; lesse taxed under the Infidell, then now
they are under the Christian.
</p>
<p>This Ile produceth the best Malvasy, Muscadine and Leaticke wines, that are in the
whole Universe. It yeeldeth Orenges, Lemmons, Mellons, Cytrons, Grenadiers, <span class="right-marginnote">[III. 79.]</span>Adams Apples, Raisins, Olives, Dates, Hony, Sugar, Vua di tre volte, and all other
kindes of fruite in abundance. But the most part of the Cornes are brought yearely
from Archipelago and Greece. <span class="marginnote"><i>The Rivers of Candy.</i></span>The chiefe Rivers are Cataracho, Melipotomos, Escasino; being all of them shallow
and discommodious for shipping, in respect of their short courses, and rocky passages:
And the principall Citties of olde, were Gnassus, where Minos kept his Court, 2. Cortina,
3. Aphra and Cydonia. This Countrey was by Marcellus made subject to the Romanes:
It was afterward given by Baldwin Earle of Flanders, the first Latin Emperor of Constantinople
to Boniface of Montserrat, who sold it, Anno 1194. to the Venetians.

strength very curteously performed; and would also have diswaded me from my purpose,
but I by no perswasion of him would stay. From thence departing, all alone, scarcely
was I advanced twelve miles in my way, when I was beset on the skirt of a Rocky Mountaine;
with three Greeke murdering Renegadoes, and an Italian <span class="right-marginnote">[III. 80.]</span>Bandido: who laying hands on me, beate me most cruelly, robbed me of all my clothes,
and stripped me naked, threatning me with many grievous speeches.
</p>
<p>At last the respective Italian, perceiving I was a stranger, and could not speake
the Cretan tongue, began to aske me in his owne language, where was my money? to whom
I soberly answered, I had no more then he saw, which was fourescore Bagantines: which
scarcely amounted to two groats English: But he not giving credit to these words,
searched all my clothes and Budgeto, yet found nothing except my linnen, and Letters
of recommendations I had from divers Princes of Christendome, especially the Duke
of Venice, whose subjects they were, if they had beene lawfull subjects: Which when
he saw, did move him to compassion, and earnestly entreated the other three theeves
to grant me mercy, and to save my life: <span class="marginnote"><i>A happy deliverance.</i></span>A long deliberation being ended, they restored backe againe my Pilgrimes clothes,
and Letters, but my blew gowne and Bagantines they kept: Such also was their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73">73</a>]</span>theevish courtesie toward me, that for my better safegard in the way, they gave me
a stamped piece of clay, as a token to shew any of their companions, if I encountred
with any of them; for they were about twenty Rascalles of a confederate band, that
lay in this desart passage.
</p>
<p>Leaving them with many counterfeit thankes, I travelled that day seaven and thirty
miles, and at night attained to the unhappy Village of Pickehorno: where I could have
neither meate, drinke, lodging, nor any refreshment to my wearied body. These desperate
Candiots thronged about me, gazing (as though astonished) to see me both want company,
and their Language, and by their cruell <span class="right-marginnote">[III. 81.]</span>lookes, they seemed to be a barbarous and uncivill people: <span class="marginnote"><i>Cruell Candiots.</i></span>For all these High-landers of Candy, are tyrannicall, blood-thirsty, and deceitfull.
The consideration of which and the appearance of my death, signed to me secretly by
a pittifull woman, made me to shun their villany in stealing forth from them in the
darke night, and privately sought for a secure place of repose in a umbragious Cave
by the Sea side, where I lay till morning with a fearefull heart, a crased body, a
thirstie stomacke, and a hungry belly.
</p>
<p>Upon the appearing of the next Aurora, and when the welkin, had put aside the vizard
of the night, the Starres being coverd, and the earth discoverd by the Sunne; I imbraced
my unknowne way, and about midday came to Canea: <span class="marginnote"><i>Invinceable Canea.</i></span>Canea is the second Citie of Creete, called aunciently Cydon, being exceeding populous,
well walled, and fortified with Bulwarkes: It hath a large Castle, containing ninety
seaven Pallaces, in which the Rector and other Venetian Gentlemen dwell. There lye
continually in it seaven Companies of Souldiers who keepe Centinell on the walles,
guarde the gates and Market places of the Citie: Neither in this Towne nor Candia,
may any Countrey Peasant enter with weapons (especially Harquebuzes) for that conceived
feare they have of Treason. Truely this City may equall in strength, either Zara in
Dalmatia, or Luka, or Ligorne, both in Tuscana, or matchlesse Palma in Friuly: for
these five Cities are so <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74">74</a>]</span>strong, that in all my Travells I never saw them matched. They are all well provided
with abundance of Artilery, and all necessary things for their defence, especially
Luka, which continually reserves in store provision of victuals for twelve yeares
siege.
</p>
<p>In my first abode in Canea, being a fortnight, there came 6. Gallies from Venice,
upon one of which there <span class="right-marginnote">[III. 82.]</span>was a young French Gentleman, a Protestant, borne neare Monpeillier in Langadocke;
who being by chance in company with other foure of his Countrey-men in Venice, one
of them killed a young Noble Venetian, about the quarrell of a Courtezan: Whereupon
they flying to the French Ambassadours house, the rest escaped, and he onely apprehended
by a fall in his flight, was afterward condemned by the Senatours to the Galleys induring
life. Now the Galleys lying here sixe dayes, he got leave of the Captaine to come
a shoare with a Keeper, when he would, carrying an yron bolt on his legge: In which
time we falling in acquaintance, he complained heavily of his hard fortune, and how
because he was a Protestant, (besides his slavery) he was severely abused in the Galley;
<span class="marginnote"><i>A Religious comfort.</i></span>sighing forth these words with teares, Lord have mercy upon me, and graunt me patience,
for neither friends, nor money can redeeme me: At which expression I was both glad
and sorrowfull, the one moving my soule to exult in joy for his Religion: the other,
for his misfortunes, working a Christian condolement for intolerable affliction: For
I was in Venice, at that same time when this accident fell out, yet would not tell
him so much: But pondering seriously his lamentable distresse, I secretly advised
him the manner how he might escape, and how farre I would hazard the liberty of my
life for his deliverance, desiring him to come a shoare earely the next morning. Meane
while I went to an old Greekish woman, with whom I was friendly inward, for she was
my Landresse; and reciting to her the whole businesse, she willingly condiscended
to lend me an old gowne, and a blacke vaile for his disguisement. The time come, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75">75</a>]</span>we met, the matter was difficult to shake off the Keeper; but such was my plot, I
did invite him to the Wine, where <span class="right-marginnote">[III. 83.]</span>after tractall discourses, and deepe draughts of Leatick, reason failing, sleepe overcame
his sences. Whereupon conducting my friend to the appointed place, I disburdened him
of his Irons, clothed him in a female habite, and sent him out before me, conducted
by the Greekish woman: And when securely past both Guards and Gate, I followed, carrying
with me his clothes: where, when accoasting him by a field of Olives, and the other
returned backe, we speedily crossed the vale of Suda, and interchanging his apparrell,
I directed him the way over <span class="marginnote"><i>A place of refuge.</i></span>the Mountaines to a Greekish convent on the South side of the land, a place of safeguard,
called commonly the Monastery of refuge; where he would kindly be entertained, till
either the Galleys, or men of Warre of Malta arrived: It being a custome at their
going, or comming from the Levante to touch here, to relieve and carry away distressed
men: This is a place whereunto Bandits, men slayers, and robbers repaire for reliefe.
</p>
<p>And now many joyfull thanks from him redounded, I returned keeping the high way, where
incontinent I encountred two English Souldiers, John Smith, and Thomas Hargrave, comming
of purpose to informe me of an eminent danger, shewing me that all the Officers of
the Galleys, with a number of Souldiers were in searching the City, and hunting all
over the fields for me: After which relation, consulting with them, what way I could
come to the Italian Monastery Saint Salvator, for there I lay; (the vulgar Towne affording
neither lodging nor beds)<span class="corr" id="xd29e2429" title="Not in source">.</span> They answered me, they would venture their lives for my liberty, and I should enter
at the Easterne (the least frequented) gate of the City, where three other English
men were that day on guard, for so there were five of them here in Garison: Where,
when we came, <span class="right-marginnote">[III. 84.]</span>the other English accompanied with eight French souldiers their familiars, came along
with us also: And having past the Market place, and neere my lodging, foure <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76">76</a>]</span>Officers and sixe Galley souldiers, runne to lay hands on me: whereat the English
and French unsheathing their Swords, valiantly resisted their fury, and deadly wounded
two of the Officers: Meane while fresh supply comming from the Galleys, John Smith
runne along with me to the Monastery, leaving the rest at pell mell, to intercept
their following: At last the Captaines of the Garrison approaching the tumult, relieved
their owne Souldiers, and drove backe the other to the Galleys. A little thereafter
the Generall of the Galleys come to the Monastery, and examined me concerning the
fugitive, but I cleering my selfe so, and quenching the least suspition he might conceive
(notwithstanding of mine accusers) hee could lay nothing to my charge: howsoever it
was, he seemed somewhat favourable; partly, because I had the Duke of Venice his Pasport,
partly, because of mine intended voyage to Jerusalem; partly, because he was a great
favourer of the French Nation: and partly because he could not mend himselfe, in regard
of my shelter, and the Governours favour: yet neverthelesse, I detained my selfe under
<span class="marginnote"><i>Cloysters are safeguards.</i></span>safeguard of the Cloyster, untill the Galleys were gone.
</p>
<p>Being here disappointed of transportation to Archipelago, I advised to visit Candy:
and in my way I past by the large Haven of Suda, which hath no Towne or Village, save
onely a Castle, situated on a Rocke in the Sea, at the entry of the Bay: the bounds
of that Harbour may receive at one time above two thousand Shippes and Galleys, and
is the onely Key of the Iland: for the which place, the King of Spaine hath oft offered
an infinite deale of money to the Venetians, whereby his Navy <span class="right-marginnote">[III. 85.]</span>which sometimes resort in the Levante, might have accesse and reliefe; but they would
never graunt him his request; which policy of his was onely to have surprized the
Kingdome.
</p>
<p>South-west from this famous harbour, lieth a pleasant plaine surnamed <span class="marginnote"><i>The pleasant valley of Suda.</i></span>the Valley of Suda: It is twenty Italian Miles long, and two of breadth: And I remember,
or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77">77</a>]</span>I discended to crosse the Valley, and passe the haven, me thought the whole planure
resembled to me a greene sea; and that was onely by reason of infinite Olive trees
grew there, whose boughes and leaves over-toppe all other fructiferous trees in that
plaine: The Villages for losse of ground are all built on the skirts of Rockes, upon
the South side of the Valley; yea, and so difficile to climbe them, and so dangerous
to dwell in them, that me thought their lives were in like perill, as he who was adjoyned
to sit under the poynt of a two handed sword, and it hanging by the haire of a horse
tayle.
</p>
<p>Trust me, I told along these Rockes at one time, and within my sight, some 67. Villages;
but when I entred the valley, I could not find a foote of ground unmanured, save a
narrow passing way wherein I was: The Olives, Pomgranets, Dates, Figges, Orenges,
Lemmons, and Pomi del Adamo growing all through other: And at the rootes of which
trees grew Wheate, Malvasie, Muscadine, Leaticke Wines, Grenadiers, Carnobiers, Mellones,
and all other sorts of fruites and hearbes, the earth can yeeld to man; that for beauty,
pleasure, and profit it may easily be surnamed, the garden of the whole Universe:
being the goodliest plot, the Diamond sparke, and the Honny spot of all Candy: There
is no land more temperate for ayre, for it hath a double spring-tyde; no soyle more
<span class="right-marginnote">[III. 86.]</span>fertile, and therefore it is called the Combat of Bachus and Ceres; nor region or
valley more hospitable, in regard of the sea, having such a noble haven cut through
its bosome, being as it were the very resting place of Neptune.
</p>
<p>Upon the third dayes journey from Canea, I came to Rethimos; This City is somewhat
ruinous, and unwalled, but the Citizens have newly builded a strong Fortresse, but
rather done by the State of Venice, which defendeth them from the invasion of Pyrats:
It standeth by the sea side, and in the yeare 1597. It was miserably sacked, and burned
with Turkes. Continuing my voyage, I passed along the skirt of <span class="marginnote"><i>Mount Ida.</i></span>Mount Ida, accompanied with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78">78</a>]</span>Greekes, who could speake the Italian tongue, on which, first they shewed me the cave
of King Minos, but some hold it to be the Sepulcher of Jupiter. That Groto was of
length eighty paces, and eight large: This Minos was sayd to be the brother of Radamanthus,
and Sarpedon; who, after their succession to the Kingdome, established such æquitable
lawes, that by Poets they are feigned with Æacus to be the Judges of Hell. I saw also
there, the place where Jupiter (as they say) was nourished by Amalthes, which by Greekes
is recited, as well as Latine Poets.
</p>
<p>Thirdly, they shewed me the Temple of Saturne, which is a worke to be admired, of
such Antiquity, and as yet undecayed; who (say they) was the first King that inhabited
there, and Father to Jupiter. And neare to it is the demolished Temple of Matelia,
having this superscription above the doore, yet to be seene: Make cleane your feete,
wash your hands and enter. Fourthly, I saw the entry into the <span class="marginnote"><i>Dedalus Laborinth.</i></span>Laborinth of Dedalus, which I would gladly have better viewed, but because we had
no Candle-light, we durst not enter: for there are many hollow places within it: so
that if a man stumble, or fall, <span class="right-marginnote">[III. 87.]</span>he can hardly be rescued: It is cut forth with many intricating wayes, on the face
of a little hill, joyning with Mount Ida, having many doores and pillars. Here it
was where Theseus by the helpe of Ariadne the daughter of King Minos, taking a bottome
of threed, and tying the one end at the first doore, did enter and slay the Minotaurus,
who was included there by Dedalus: This Minotaure is sayd to have bene begot by the
lewd and luxurious Pasiphae, who doted on a white Bull.
</p>
<p>Mount Ida is the highest Mountaine in Creta, and by the computation of Shepheards
feete, amounteth to sixe miles of height: It is over-clad even to the toppe with Cypre
trees, and good store of medicinable hearbes: insomuch that the beasts which feede
thereupon, have their teeth gilded, like to the colour of Gold: Mount Ida, of old
was called Phelorita, by some Cadussa, but <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79">79</a>]</span>modernely Madura: It is sayd by some Historians, that no venemous animall can live
in this Ile; but I saw the contrary: <span class="marginnote"><i>Historian errours.</i></span>For I kild on a Sunday morning hard by the Sea-side, and within two miles of Rethimos,
two Serpents and a Viper: One of which Serpents, was above a yard and halfe in length,
for they being all three rolling within the coverture of the dry sands, my right legge
was almost in their reverence before I remarked the danger: Wherefore many build upon
false reports, but experience teacheth men the trueth.
</p>
<p>Some others also Historize, that if a Woman here, bite a man any thing hard, he will
never recover: and that there is an hearbe called Allimos in this Iland, which if
one chaw in his mouth, he shall not feele hunger for foure and twenty howres: all
which are meere fabulous, such is the darkenesse of cloudy inventions.
</p>
<p>Descending from this Mountaine, I entred in a faire <span class="right-marginnote">[III. 88.]</span>plaine, beautified with many Villages; in one of which, I found a Grecian Bishop,
who kindly presented me with grapes of Malvasie, and other things, for it was in the
time of their vintage. To carry these things he had given me, he caused to make ready
an Asse, and a Servant, who went with me to Candy, which was more then fifteene miles
from his house. True it is, that the best sort of Greekes, in visiting other, doe
not use to come empty handed, neither will they suffer a stranger to depart without
both gifts and convoy.
</p>
<p>I remember along this sassinous and marine passage, I found three fountaines gushing
forth of a Rocke, each one within a yard of other, having three sundry tasts: the
first water was exceeding light, and sweet; the middle or second, marvelous sowre
and heavy: the third was bitter and extraordinary salt: so that in so short bounds
so great difference, I never found before, nor afterward.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The City of Candy.</i></span>Candy is distant from Canea a hundreth miles, Rethimos being halfe way betwixt both:
so is Candy halfe way in the same measure, twixt Rethimos and Scythia, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80">80</a>]</span>Canea the like twixt Rethimos and Carabusa, being in all 200. miles.
</p>
<p>Candy is a large and famous City, formerly called Matium, situated on a plaine by
the sea side, having a goodly Haven for shippes, and a faire Arsenall wherein are
36. Gallies: It is exceeding strong, and dayly guarded with 2000. Souldiers, and the
walles in compasse are about three leagues.
</p>
<p>In this time there was no Viceroy, the former being newly dead, and the place vacant,
the Souldiers kept a bloody quarter among themselves, or against any whomsoever their
malignity was intended, for in all the time I stayed there being ten dayes, it was
nothing to see every <span class="right-marginnote">[III. 89.]</span>day foure or five men killed in the streetes: neither could the Rector, nor the Captaines
helpe it, so tumultuous were the disordered Souldiers, and the occasions of revenge
and quarrellings so influent. This commonly they practise in every such like vacation,
which otherwise, they durst never attempt without death, and severe punishment; and
truely me thought it was as barbarous a governed place for the time, as ever I saw
in the world: For hardly could I save my owne life free from their dangers, in the
which I was twice miserably involved.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Distances from Candy.</i></span>Candy is distant from Venice 1300. miles, from Constantinople 700. from Famagusta
in Cyprus, 600. from Alexandria in Ægypt, 500. from Tripoli in Siria 700. from Naples
900. from Malta 500. from Smyrna, in Carmania of Natolia 400. and from the Citty of
Jerusalem, 900. miles. The Candeots through all the Iland, make muster every eight
day, before the Serjant-majors, or Officers of the Generall, and are well provided
with all sorts of Armour; yea, and the most valerous people that hight the name of
Greekes. It was told me by the Rector of Candy, that they may raise in Armes of the
Inhabitants (not reckoning the Garrisons) above sixty thousand men, all able for warres,
with 54. Gallies, and 24. Galleots for the sea.
</p>
<p>In all my travels through this Realme, I never could <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81">81</a>]</span>see a Greeke come forth of his house unarmed: and after such a martiall manner, that
on his head he weareth a bare steele cap, a bow in his hand, a long sword by his side,
a broad Ponard overthwart his belly, and a round Target hanging at his girdle. They
are not costly in apparell, for they weare but linnen cloathes, and use no shooes
but bootes of white leather, to keepe their legges in the fields from the prickes
of a kind of Thistle, wherewith <span class="right-marginnote">[III. 90.]</span>the Countrey is overcharged like unto little bushes or short shrubs which are marvelous
sharpe, and offensive unto the inhabitants, whereof, often a day to my great harme,
I found their bloody smart: The women generally weare linnen breaches as men do, and
bootes after the same manner, and their linnen coates no longer then the middle of
their thighes, and are insatiably inclined to Venery, such is the nature of the soyle
and climate. The <span class="marginnote"><i>Creets turnd Critticks.</i></span>auncient Cretans were such notable lears, that the heathen Poet Epimenides, yea, and
the Apostle Paul in his Epistle to Titus, did tearme them to have beene ever liers,
evill beasts, and slow bellies: whence sprung these proverbs, as <span lang="la">Cretense mendacium, &amp; cretisandum est cum cretensibus</span>.
</p>
<p>The Candiots are excellent good Archers, surpassing all the Orientall people therein,
couragious and valiant upon the Sea, as in former times they were; and they are naturally
inclined to singing: so that commonly after meat, Man, Wife, and Child of each family,
will for the space of an houre, sing with such a harmony, as is wonderfull melodious
to the hearer; yea, and they cannot forgoe the custome of it.
</p>
<p>Their Harvest is our Spring: for they manure the ground, and sow the seed in October,
which is reaped in March, and Aprill. Being frustrate of my intention at Candy, I
was forced to returne to Canea the same way I went: when come, I was exceeding merry
with my old friends the English-men: Meane-while there arrived from Tunnis in Barbary,
<span class="marginnote"><i>An English runagate.</i></span>an English Runagate named Wolson, bound for the Rhodes: where after short acquaintance
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82">82</a>]</span>with his natives, and understanding what I was, he imparted these words, I have had
my elder brother, sayd he, the Maister (or Captaine) of a ship, slaine at Burnt-Iland
<span class="right-marginnote">[III. 91.]</span>in Scotland by one called Keere; and notwithstanding he was beheaded, I have long
since sworne to be revenged of my brothers death, on the first Scotsman I ever saw
or met, and my designe is, to stob him with a knife this night, as he goeth late home
to his lodging desiring their assistance: But Smith, Hargrave, and Horsfeild refused,
yet Cooke and Rollands yeelded. Meane-while Smith knowing where I used sometimes to
diet, found me at supper in a Sutlers, a souldiers house, where acquainting me with
this plot, the hoste, he, and three Italian souldiers conveighed me to my bed, passing
by the arch-villaine, and his confederats, where he was prepared for the mischiefe:
which when he saw his treachery was discovered, he fled away, &amp; was seene no more
here.
</p>
<p>Remarking the fidelity and kindnesse that Smith had twice shewen me, first in freeing
me from the danger of galley-slavery, and now in saving my life, I advised to doe
him a good deed in some part of acquittance, and thus it was: <span class="marginnote"><i>Smith relieved from long bondage.</i></span>At his first comming to Venice, he was taken up as a souldier for Candy: where, when
transported, within a small time he found the Captaines promise and performance different,
which enforced him at the beginning to borrow a little money of his Lieutenant: the
five yeares of their abode expired, and fresh Companies come from Venice to exhibit
the charge, Smith not being able to discharge his debt, was turned over to the new
Captaine for five yeares more, who payed the old Captaine his mony; and his time also
worne out, the third Captaine came, where likewise he was put in his hands serving
him five yeares longer.
</p>
<p>Thus having served three Captaines fifteene yeares, and never likely able (for a small
trifle) to attaine his liberty, <span class="right-marginnote">[III. 92.]</span>I went to the Captaine and payed his debt, obtaining also of the Rector his licence
to depart; and the allowance <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83">83</a>]</span>of the State for his passage, which was Wine and Biscot-bread: Thereafter: I imbarked
him for Venice in a Flemish ship, the Maister being a Scotsman, John Allen borne in
Glasgow, and dwelt at Middleborough in Zeland, his debt was onely forty eight shillings
starling.
</p>
<p>Here I stayed in Canea twenty five dayes before I could get passage for the Arch Ilands,
being purposed for Constantinople; but gladly would not have left the Monastary of
these foure Friars, with whom I was lodged, if it had not beene for my designes; in
regard of their great cheere and deepe draughts of Malvasey I received hourely, and
oftentimes against my will: Every night after supper, the Friars forced me to dance
with them, either one gagliard or other: <span class="marginnote"><i>Drunken Fryers.</i></span>Their Musicke in the end was sound drunkennesse, and their Syncopa turnd to spew up
all, and their bed converted to a boord, or else the hard floore, for these beastly
swine, were nightly so full, that they had never power to goe to their owne chambers,
but where they fell, there they lay till the morne: the cloyster it selfe had two
faire Courts, the least of which might have lodged any King of Europe: The Church
was little, and among the foure Friars, there was but one Masse-Priest, being a Greeke
borne and turn&#x2019;d to the Roman faction: his new name was Pattarras Matecarras, Pater
Libenter, or Father of free will, indeed a right name for so sottish a fellow, for
he was so free of his stomacke to receive in strong liquor, that for the space of
twenty dayes of my being there, I never saw him, nor any one of the other three truely
sober. Many odde merriments and jests have I observed of these Friars of Candie, but
time will not suffer me to relate them, onely remitting the rest to my privat discourse,
a figge for their folly.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[III. 93.]</span>I travelled on foot in this Ile more then foure hundred miles, and upon the fifty
eight day after my first comming to Carabusa, I imbarked in a Fisher-boat that belonged
to Milo, being a hundred miles distant, which had beene violently driven thither with
stormy weather.
</p>
<p>And in our passing thither, we were in danger to be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84">84</a>]</span>over-runne two severall times, with two huge broken Seas, which twice covered the
body of the closse boat: yet with extreame fortune we arrived at Milo in a bay of
the East corner of the Ile, being about St. Andrewes day, where the poore Greeks tooke
me up to their Village, two miles distant from this Creeke, and I abode with them
foure dayes.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Milo.</i></span>Milo was called by Aristotle, Melada, and by others, Mimalida, Melos: And lastly Milo;
because of the fine mil-stones that are got there, which are transported to Constantinople,
Greece, and Natolia. This Ile is one of the Iles Cyclades, or Sporades, but more commonly
Archipelago, or the Arch-Ilands, and standeth in the beginning of the Ægean sea: The
Inhabitants are Greekes, but slaves to the Turke, and so are all the fifty foure Iles
of the Cyclades, save onely Tino, which holdeth of the Venetians.
</p>
<p>From Milo I came to Zephano in a small boat, an Iland of circuit about twenty miles,
and ten miles distant from Milo: The Inhabitants are poore, yet kind people: There
are an infinite number of Partridges within this Ile, of a reddish colour, and bigger
then ours in Brittaine: They are wilde, and onely killed by small shot; but I have
seene in other Ilands flockes of them feeding in the fields, and usually kept by children:
Some others I have seene <span class="right-marginnote">[III. 94.]</span>in the streetes of Villages, without any keeper, even as our Hennes doe with us. I
saw fountaines here, that naturally yeeld fine Oyle, which is the greatest advantage
the Ilanders have.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Zephano.</i></span>Zephano did once produce the Calamita, and was renowned for the fine Mines of Gold
and Silver, of which now it is altogether desolate: There is also fine Sulphur here,
and exceeding good Marble: from whence Lucullus was the first that transported it
to Rome: There is a certaine ground in this Ile, where it is sayd, that if any take
it away, or digge deepe holes, the earth of it selfe in a small time will surcrease
without any ayde of man. East from Milo and Zephano, lye the Iles Policandro, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85">85</a>]</span>and Christiana, formerly Laguso, Sicandro; and Sasurnino, anciently Calistha, famous
for the birth of the Poet Calimachus.
</p>
<p>From thence I imbarked, and arrived at Angusa in <span class="marginnote"><i>Parir.</i></span>Parir: This Ile is forty miles long, and sixe miles broad: being plentifull enough
in all necessary things for the use of man: It was aunciently called Demetriado, whose
length lieth South-west, and North-East: And hard by the high Mountaine of Camphasia,
neere to Angusa, on a faire Valley standeth the auncient Temple of Venus, never a
whit decayed to this day: This Ile was given to the Venetians by Henry the Constantinopolitan
Emperour, and brother to Baldwin Earle of Flanders: and it was seazed upon by Mahomet,
when Nigropont, and diverse other Iles were surprised from the Venetians.
</p>
<p>In Angusa I stayed sixteene dayes, storme-sted with Northernely winds; and in all
that time, I never came in bed: for my lodging was in a little Chappell a mile without
the Village, on hard stones; where I also had a fire, and dressed my meate. The Greekes
visited me oftentimes, &amp; intreated me above all things I should not <span class="right-marginnote">[III. 95.]</span>enter within the bounds of their Sanctuary; because I was not of their Religion. But
I in regard of the longsome and cold nights, was enforced every night to creepe in,
in the midst or the Sanctuary to keepe my selfe warme, which Sanctuary was nothing
but an Aultar hembd in with a partition wall about my height, dividing the little
roome from the body of the Chappell.
</p>
<p>These miserable Ilanders, are a kind of silly poore people; which in their behaviour,
shewed the necessity they had to live, rather then any pleasure in their living. From
thence I imbarked on a small barke of ten Tunnes come from Scithia in Candy, and loaden
with Oyle, and about midday we arrived in the Ile of Mecano, where we but only dined,
and so set forward to Zea.
</p>
<p>This Mecano was formely called Delos, famous for the Temple of Apollo, being the chiefe
Ile of the Cyclades, the rest of the 54. incircling it: Delos signifieth apparant,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86">86</a>]</span>because at the request of Juno, when all the earth had <span class="marginnote"><i>Latona receaved in Delos.</i></span>abjured the receipt of Latona: This Iland then under the water, was by Jupiter erected
aloft, and fixt to receive her, wherein she was delivered of Apollo, and Diana:

send them to Rhena a small Isoletta, and two miles distant.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[III. 96.]</span>Zea to which we arrived from Mecano, was so called of Zeo, the sonne of Phebo; and
of some, Tetrapoli; because of the foure Citties that were there of old. Symonides
the Poet, and Eristato the excellent Physition, were borne in it. The next Ile of
any note we touched at, was Tino: This Iland is under the Signory of Venice, and was
sometime beautified with the Temple of Neptune. By Aristotle it was called Idrusa;
of Demostenes, and Eschines, Erusea: It hath an impregnable Castle, builded on the
top of a high Rocke, towards the East-end or Promontore of the Ile, and ever provided
with three yeares provision, and a Garison of two hundreth Souldiers: So that the
Turkes by no meanes can conquer it. The Iland it selfe is twenty miles in length,
and a great refuge for all Christian Shippes and Galleys that haunt in the Levante.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The Ile of Pathmos.</i></span>From this Ile I came to Palmosa, sometime Pathmos, which is a mountainous and barren
Iland: It was here that Saint John wrote the Revelation after he was banished by Domitianus
the Emperour. Thence I imbarked to Nicaria, and sayled by the Ile Scyro; which of
old was the Signory of Licomedes, and in the habit of a woman, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87">87</a>]</span>was Achilles brought up here, because his mother being by an Oracle premonished, that
he should be killed in the Trojan Warre, sent him to this Iland; where he was maiden-like
brought up amongst the Kings daughters: who in that time, begot Pyrhus upon Deidamia,
the daughter of Licomedes, and where the crafty Ulysses afterward did discover this
fatall Prince to Troy. As we fetched up the sight of Nicaria, we espied two Turkish
Galleots, who gave us the Chace, and pursued us, straight to a bay, betwixt two Mountaines,
where we left the loaden boate, and fled to the Rockes, from whence we mightily annoyed
with huge tumbling stones, the persuing <span class="right-marginnote">[III. 97.]</span>Turkes: But in our flying, the Maister was taken, and other two old men; whom they
made captives and slaves: and also seized upon the Boate, and all their goods: The
number of us that escaped were nine persons.
</p>
<p>This Ile Nicaria, was aunciently called Doliche, and Ithiosa, and is somewhat barren:
having no Sea-port at all: It was here, the Poets feigned, that Icarus the sonne of
Dedalus fell, when as he tooke flight from Creta, with his borrowed wings, of whom
it hath the name; and <span class="marginnote"><i>Ovid de Trist.</i></span>not following directly his father Dedalus, was here drowned.

</div>
</div>
<p class="first">Expecting certaine dayes here, in a Village called Laphantos, for passage to Sio,
at last I found a Brigandino bound thither, that was come from the fruitfull Ile of
Stalimene, of old Lemnos. This Ile of Stalimene is in circuit 90. miles, where in
Hephestia it&#x2019;s Metropolis, <span class="marginnote"><i>Vulcans birth.</i></span>Vulcan was mightily adored; who being but a homely brat, was cast downe hither by
Juno, whereby it was no <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88">88</a>]</span>marvaile if he became crooked, and went a halting: The soveraigne minerall against
infections, called Teera Lemnia, or Sigillata is digged here: The former name proceedeth
from the Iland: The latter is in force, because the earth being made up in little
pellets, is sealed with a Turkish Signet, and so sold, and dispersed over Christendome.
Having imbarked in the aforesaid Brigandine, we sayled by the Ile Samos, which is
opposite to Caria, in Asia minor, where the Tyrant Policrates lived <span class="right-marginnote">[III. 98.]</span>so fortunate, as he had never any mischance all this time, till at last Orientes a
Persian brought him to a miserable death: Leaving us an example, that fortune is certaine
in nothing but in incertainties, who like a Bee with a sharpe sting, hath alwaies
some misery following a long concatenation of felicities: It is of circuit 160. and
of length 40. miles: It was of old named Driusa, and Melanphilo, in which Pythagoras
the Philosopher, and Lycaon the excellent Musitioner were borne.
</p>
<p>Upon our left hand, and opposit to Samos lyeth the <span class="marginnote"><i>Nixia.</i></span>Ile of Nixia, formerly Naxos; in circuit 68. miles: It was also called the Ile of
Venus, and Dionisia, and was taken from the Venetians by Selim, the father of Soliman:
East from Nixia, lieth the Ile Amurgospolo, in circuit twenty leagues, it hath three
commodious ports, named St. Anna, Calores, and Cataplino: A little from hence, and
in sight of Natolia, lieth the Ile Calamo, formerly Claros, in circuit thirty miles:
and Eastward thence the little Ile of Lerno, five leagues in circuit, all inhabited
with Greeks, and they, the silly ignorants of nature: South-east from this lieth the
<span class="marginnote"><i>The Ile of Lango.</i></span>Ile of Coos now Lango: by the Turkes called Stanccow, the Capitall Towne is Arango,
where Hypocrates and Apelles the Painter were borne: In this Ile, there is a wine
named by the Greekes, Hyppocon, that excelleth in sweetnesse all other wines except
the Malvasie, and it aboundeth in Cypre and Turpentine trees: There is here a part
of the Ile disinhabited, in regard of a contagious Lake, that infecteth the ayre,
both Summer, and Winter. There is abundance of Alloes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89">89</a>]</span>found here, so much esteemed by our Pothecaries; the rest of this Ile shall be touched
in the owne place. And neere to Lango, lyeth the Ile Giara, now Stopodia, it is begirded
with Rocks and desartuous, unto which the <span class="right-marginnote">[III. 99.]</span>Romans were wont to send in banishment such as deserved death: In generall of these
Iles Cyclads, because they are so neere one to another, and each one in sight of another,
there are many Cursares and Turkish Galleots, that still afflict these Ilanders: Insomuch
that the Inhabitants are constrained to keepe watch day and night, upon the tops of
the most commodious Mountaines, to discover these Pirats; which they easily discerne
from other vessells, <span class="marginnote"><i>The danger of Turkish Pirats.</i></span>both because of their Sayles and Oares: And whensoever discovered, according to the
number of cursary Boates, they make as many fires, which giveth warning to all the
Ports to be on guard: And if the Sea voyagers in passing see no signe on these Iles,
of fire or smoake, then they perfectly know, these Laborinthing Seas, are free from
pestilent Raveners.
</p>
<p>As we left the Ile Venico on our left hand, and entred in the gulfe betweene Sio,
and Eolida, the firme land is called Æolida, there fell downe a deadly storme, at
the Grecoe Levante, or at the North-east, which split our Mast, carrying sayles and
all over-boord: Whereupon every man looked (as it were) with the stampe of death in
his pale visage. The tempest continuing (our Boate not being able to keepe the Seas)
we were constrained to seeke into a creeke, betwixt two Rocks, for safety of our lives;
where, when we entred, there was no likely-hood of reliefe: for we had a shelfie shoare,
and giving ground to the Ankors, they came both home.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>A fearfull shipwracke.</i></span>The sorrowfull Maister seeing nothing but shipwrack, tooke the Helme in hand, directing
his course to rush upon the face of a low Rocke, whereupon the sea most fearefully
broke. As we touched the Mariners contending who should first leape out, some fell
over-boord, and those that got land, were pulled backe by the reciprocating <span class="right-marginnote">[III. 100.]</span>waves: Neither in all this time durst I once move; for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90">90</a>]</span>they had formerly sworne, if I pressed to escape, before the rest were first forth,
they would throw me headlong into the sea: So being two wayes in danger of death,
I patiently offered up my prayers to God.
</p>
<p>At our first encounter with the Rocks, (our fore-decks, and Boates gallery being broke,
and a great Lake made) the recoiling waves brought us backe from the Shelfes a great
way; which the poore Master perceiving, and that there were seven men drowned, and
eleven persons alive, cryed with a loud voyce: Be of good courage, take up oares,
and row hastily; it may be, before the Barke sinke, we shall attaine to yonder Cave,
which then appeared to our sight: Every man working for his owne deliverance (as it
pleased God) we got the same with good fortune: for no sooner were we disbarked, and
I also left the last man, but the Boat immediately sunke. There was nothing saved
but my Coffino, which I kept alwaies in my armes: partly, that it might have brought
my dead body to some creeke, where being found, might have beene by the Greekes buryed;
and partly I held it fast also, <span class="marginnote"><i>A happy deliverance from shipwracke.</i></span>that saving my life, I might save it too; it was made of Reeds and would not easily
sinke, notwithstanding of my papers and linnen I carried into it: for the which safety
of my things, the Greekes were in admiration. In this Cave, which was 30. paces long,
within the mountaine, we abode three daies without either meate or drinke: upon the
fourth day at morne, the tempest ceasing, there came Fisher-boates to relieve us,
who found the ten Greekes almost famished for lacke of foode; but I in that hunger-starving
feare, fed upon the expectation of my doubtfull reliefe.
</p>
<p>True it is, a miserable thing it is for man, to grow an example to others in matters
of affliction, yet it is necessary that some men should be so: For it pleased <span class="right-marginnote">[III. 101.]</span>God, having showne a sensible disposition of favour upon me, in humbling me to the
very pit of extremities, taught me also by such an unexpected deliverance, both to
put my confidence in his eternall goodnesse, and to know the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91">91</a>]</span>frailty of my owne selfe, and my ambition, which drave me often to such disasters.
</p>
<p>The dead men being found on shoare, we buried them; and I learned at that instant
time, there were seventeene boats cast away on the Coast of this Iland, and never
a man saved: in this place the Greekes set up a stone crosse in the memoriall of such
a woefull mischance, and mourned heavily, fasting and praying. I rejoycing and thanking
God for my safety (leaving them sorrowing for their friends and goods) tooke journey
through the Iland to Sio, for so is the City called, being thirty miles distant: In
my way I past by an old Castle standing on a little hill, named Garbos, now Helias;
where (as I was informed by two Greekes in my company) the Sepulcher of Homer was
yet extant: for this Sio is one of the seven Iles and Townes, that contended for his
birth:

understand for their antiquity; but whether it was this Tombe or not, I doe not know,
but this they related, and yet very likely to have beene his Sepulcher.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[III. 102.]</span><span class="marginnote"><i>Sio.</i></span>This Ile of Sio is divided into two parts, to wit, Appanomera, signifying the higher,
or upper parts of it: The other Catomerea, that is, the levell, or lower parts of
the Ile: It was first called Ethalia: It aboundeth so in Oranges and Lemmons, that
they fill Barrels and Pipes with the juyce thereof, and carry them to Constantinople,
which the Turkes use at their meate, as we doe the Verges. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92">92</a>]</span>And also called Pythiosa; next Cios, Acts 20. 15. And by Methrodorus, Chio, <span class="corr" id="xd29e2763" title="Source: of">or</span> Chione: but at this day Sio. Not long agoe it was under the Genueses, but now governed
by the Turkes: It is of circuite an hundreth miles, and famous for the medicinable
Masticke that groweth there on Trees: I saw many pleasant Gardens in it, which yeeld
in great plenty, Orenges, Lemmons, Apples, Peares, Prunes, Figges, Olives, Apricockes,
Dates, Adams Apples, excellent hearbes, faire flowers, sweete Hony, with store of
Cypre and Mulbery-trees, and exceeding good silke is made here.
</p>
<p>At last I arrived at the Citty of Sio, where I was lodged, and kindly used with an
old man, of the Genuesen race, for the space of eight dayes: I found here three Monasteries
of the order of Rome, one of the Jesuits, another of Saint Francis, and the third
of the Dominican Friers, being all come from Genoa; and because the greatest part
of the Citty is of that stocke, and of the Papall Sea, these Cloysters have a braver
life for good cheare, fat Wines, and delicate Leachery, than any sort of Friers can
elsewhere find in the world.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The faire Dames of Sio.</i></span>The Women of the Citty Sio, are the most beautifull Dames, (or rather Angelicall creatures)

and when they see any stranger arrive, they will presently demaund of him; if he would

now detained by a Garison of Turkes, containing a thousand fire-houses within it,
some whereof are Greekes, some Genoueses, some Turkes, and Moores: The Citty it selfe
is unwalled, yet a populous and spacious place, spred along by the Sea-side, having
a goodly harbour for Galleyes and Ships, the chiefe Inhabitants there, are descended
of the Genoueses, and professe the superstition of Rome: The people whereof were once
Lords of the Ægean Sea, maintaining a Navy of eighty Ships: In the ende they became
successively subject to the Romane and Greeke Princes; till Andronico Paleologus,
gave them and their Ile to the Justinianes, a Noble Family of the Genoueses: from
whom it was taken by Solyman the Magnificent on Easter day 1566. being the same yeare
that our late gracious, and once Soveraigne Lord, King James of blessed memory was
borne. This Cittadale or Fortresse of Sio, standeth full betweene the <span class="right-marginnote">[III. 104.]</span>Sea, and the Harbour, was invaded by 800. Florentines, sent hither by the great Duke
Ferdinando, brother to Queene Mother of Fraunce, and our owne Queene Maries Unkle,
Anno 1600. August 7. The manner was thus, The Genouesen seede, had sold the Fort unto
the Duke of Florence, whereupon he sent his Galleys and these Gallants thither: Where,
when arrived in the night, they scaled the walles, slue the watches, and unhappily
ram-forced all the Canon; and then entring the Fort put all the Turkes to the sword,
and among them, too many Christians: The Galleys all this time, being doubtfull how
it went, durst not enter the harbour, but a storme falling downe, they bore up to
an Isolet for ancorage in the Æolid gulfe, and three miles distant: The next morning,
the Turkish Bashaw, the Citty, and all the Ilanders were in armes: The Florentines
being dismissed of their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94">94</a>]</span>Galleys, grew discouraged, and trying the Canon, which they had spoyled at their first
scallet, it would not be: Meane while, the Bashaw entred in parley with them, and
promised faithfully, to send them safe to the Galleys if they would render. Upon the
third day they yeeld, and as they issued forth, along the draw bridge, and the Bashaw
set in a Tent to receive them as they came in, one by one, <span class="marginnote"><i>The heads of</i> 800. <i>Florentines cut off.</i></span>he caused strike off all their heads: And done, there was a Pinacle reared upon the
Walles of the Fort with their bare sculs which stand to this day.
</p>
<p>But by your leave, Ferdinando in person, the yeare following, was more than revenged
of such a cruell and faithlesse proceeding: He over-maisterd a Turkish towne and castle,
put two thousand Turkes to the sword, sparing neither old nor young, and recoyling
infinit richesse and spoyles of the towne, he brought home their heads with him to
Ligorne, and set them up there for a mercilesse <span class="right-marginnote">[III. 105.]</span>monument.
</p>
<p>After some certaine dayes attendance, I imbarked in a Carmoesal, bound for Nigropont,
which was forth of my way to Constantinople; but because I would gladly have seene
Macedonia, and Thessaly, I followed that determination: In our way we touched at <span class="marginnote"><i>The Ile of Mytelene.</i></span>Mytelene, an Iland of old called Isa: next Lesbos: And lastly Mytelene, of Milet the
sonne of Ph&#x153;bus. Pythacus, one of the seaven Sages of Greece, the most valiant Antimenides,
and his brother Alceus the Lyricall Poet, Theophrastus the peripatetike Philosopher,
Arion the learned Harper, and the she Poet Sapho, were borne in it.
</p>
<p>This Ile of Lesbos or Mytelene, containeth in compasse, one hundreth forty sixe miles:
the East parts are levell and fruitfull, the West and South parts mountainous and
barren: The chiefe Citties are Mytelene and Methimnos: It was long under subjection
of the Romane and Greeke Emperours, till Calo Joannes, Anno 1355. gave it in dowry
with his sister, to Catalusio a Nobleman of Genoua; whose posterity enjoyed it till
Mahomet (surnamed the Greeke) did seaze on it, 1462.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95">95</a>]</span>
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>A comparison of Iles.</i></span>These Iles Sporades, are scattered in the Ægean Sea, like as the Iles Orcades are
in the North Seas of Scotland; but different in clymate and fertility: for these South-easterne
Iles in Summer are extreame hot, producing generally (Nigroponti excepted) but a few
wines, fruites, and cornes, scarce sufficient to sustaine the Ilanders. But these
North-westerne Ilands in Sommer, are neither hot nor cold; having a most wholesome
and temperate ayre: and do yeeld abundance of corne, even more then to suffice the
Inhabitants; which is yearely transported to the firme land, and sold: They have also
good store of Cattell, <span class="right-marginnote">[III. 106.]</span>and good cheape, and the best fishing that the whole Ocean yeeldeth, is upon the coasts
of Orknay and Zetland.
</p>
<p>In all these seperated parts of the Earth (which of themselves of old, made up a little
Kingdome) you shall alwaies <span class="marginnote"><i>The plentifulnesse of Orkney &amp; Zetland.</i></span>finde strong March-Ale, surpassing fine Aqua-vitæ, abundance of Geese, Hennes, Pigeons,

Connies, which you may kill with a Crosse-bow, or Harquebuse, every morning forth
of your Chamber window, according to your pleasure in that pastime, which I have both
practised my selfe, and seene practised by others; for they multiply so exceedingly,
that they digge even under the foundations of dwelling houses. Such is the will of
God to bestow upon severall places, particular blessings; whereby he demonstrateth
to man, the plentifull store-house of his gracious providence, so many manner of wayes
upon earth distributed; all glory be to his incomprehensible goodnes therefore. I
have seldome seene in all my travells, more toward, and tractable people (I meane
their Gentlemen) and better house-keepers, then be these Orcadians, and Zetlanders:
whereof in the prime of my adolescency (by two voyages amongst these Northerne Iles)
I had the full proofe and experience.
</p>
<p>And now certainely, as it is a signe of little wisedome, and greater folly, for a
man to answere suddenly to every light question; so it is as great a shame and stupiditie
in man to keepe silence, when he should, and may <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96">96</a>]</span>deservingly speake; Wherefore damnifying the one, and vilifying the other, I come
forth betweene both (Pugno pro Patria) to have a single bout with the ignorant malice
of an imperious and abortive Geographer, brought up in the Schooles neere Thames,
&amp; Westward Ho at Oxford; <span class="right-marginnote">[III. 107.]</span>who blindlings in an absurd description of the world, hath produced many errors, &amp;
manifest untrueths to the world.
</p>
<p>And these amongst thousands moe, which I justly can censure to be false; namely, he
reporteth the Orcadians to be a cruell and barbarous peeple, and that the most part
of Scotland regarded neither King nor Law: tearming us also to have monstrous backes,
against the execution of Justice: and because (saith he) they resemble us somewhat
in visage and speech, the Scots are descended of the Saxons; where when the blacke
wings of the Eagle spred in the South, they fled thither, thinking rather to enjoy
penurious liberty, then rich fetters of gold: Moreover, <span class="marginnote"><i>False aspersion upon Scotland.</i></span>that the scurvy Ile of Manne, is so abundant in Oates, Barley, and Wheate, that it
supplieth the defects of Scotland; so venemous also is the Wormewood of his braine,
that he impugneth Hector Boetius, to have mentioned a rabble of Scottish Kings before
Kenneth, the first Monarch of all Scotland; but were he fast rabled in a rope, I thinke
his presumptuous and impertinent phrase were well recompensed: Yea, further he dare
to write, that if the Mountaines, and unaccessable Woods, had not beene more true
to the Scots, then their owne valour, that Kingdome had long since beene subdued.

<p>Many other introductions flow from his shallow base-branded apprehension which I purposely
omit: To this his perverst malignitie (without partiall or particular construction)
I generally answere; that for courteous penetrating lenity; industrious tractability;
prompt and exquisite ingeniosity; nobly taught, vivacious, &amp; vertuous Gentility; humane,
and illustrious generosity; inviolate, and uncommixed nationall pedegree; Learned,
Academicall, and Ecclesiasticke Clergy; for sincere Religion, and devoute Piety; affable
and benevolent Hospitality; civill <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97">97</a>]</span><span class="right-marginnote">[III. 108.]</span>&amp; zealous orders in spirituality; so docible a people to supreame regality; and for
true valour, courage, and magnanimity; there is no Kingdome or Nation within the compasse
of the whole universe, can excell, or compare with it.
</p>
<p>Now what a selfe Losungeous fellow hath this fustian companion proved, when the flat
contrary of his abjured impositions, is infallibly knowne to be of undoubted trueth.
And how often hath Europe, the seat of Christendome, and Mistresse of the world, had
the full experience in all her distressed corners, of the valiant, faithfull service,
and unresistable valour of the people, of that never conquered Nation: the testimonies
are evident, for my part I desist, and will not medle to peramble through peremptory

<p class="first">This Ile of Mytelena, is by the Turkes called Sarcam lying without the mouth of the
gulfe of Smyrna, and opposite to the Westerne coast of Phrigia minor; where besides
excellent Wine and Cornes, there are two sorts of dregs made there, which the Turkes
use to put in their pottage: In Turkish the one is called Trachana, the other Bouhort,
which the Romanes aunciently named Crimnon and Mazza. Whence Loosing from Mitylene
in the aforesaid Carmosal, we touched at Dalamede, in the <span class="marginnote"><i>The Ile Androsia.</i></span>Ile Androsia, the Northmost Ile of the Syclades toward Thessalia: It is indifferent
copious of all things necessary for humane life, and round sixty miles: The Athenians
of old (as Plutarch mentioneth) sent hither Themistocles to demaund tribute; Themistocles
told them, he came to inflict some great imposition upon them, being accompanied with
two Goddesses; the one was (Eloquence) to perswade them, and the other was (Violence)
to enforce them. Whereunto the Androsians replyed, that on their side, they had two
Goddesses as strong; the one whereof was (Necessity) whereby they had it not; and
the other (Impossibility) whereby they could not part with that they never enjoyed.
</p>
<p>This Ægean Sea, or mare Ægeum, had its denomination from Ægeus the father of Theseus,
who misdoubting his sonnes returne from the Minotaure of Creet, here leaped <span class="right-marginnote">[III. 110.]</span>in, and drowned himselfe: The greatest part of these sixty nine Kings, that Agamemnon
tooke with him to the siege of Troy, were onely Kings of these little Ilands: By some
they are divided into two parts, Cyclades, and Sporades; the former containing fifty
foure, and the latter twelve Iles; modernely they are all cognominat Archipylago,
or the Arch Ilands.

<p>Hoysing saile from Dalamede, we set over to Nigroponti, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99">99</a>]</span>being sixty miles distant, and bearing up Eastward to double the South Cape, we straight
discovered <span class="marginnote"><i>Two Turkish Galleots.</i></span>two Turkish Galleots pursuing us: Whereupon with both sailes and oares, we sought
in to the bottome of a long creeke, on the West side of the Cape, called Bajo di piscatori;
whither also fled nine Fisher-boates for refuge: The Galleots fearing to follow us
in, went to Ankor, at a rocky Isolet in the mouth of the bay, and then within night
were resolved to assaile us. But night come, and every night of sixe (for there sixe
dayes they expected us) we made such Bonfires, that so affrighted them (being two
miles from any Village) they durst never adventure it: Yet I being a stranger was
exposed by the untoward Greekes to stand Centinell every night, on the top of a high
Promontore, it being the dead time of a snowy and frosty winter; which did invite
my Muse to bewaile the tossing of my toylesome life, my solitary wandring, and the

<p class="first">Upon the seaventh day, there came downe to visit us, two Gentlemen of Venice, clothed
after the Turkish manner; who under exile, were banished their Native Territories
ten yeares for slaughter; each of them having two servants, and all of them carrying
Shables, and two <span class="right-marginnote">[III. 114.]</span>Gunnes a peece: which when I understood, they were Italians, I addressed my selfe
to them, with a heavy complaint against the Greekes, in detaining my Budgeto, and
compelling me to endanger my life for their goods: whereupon they accusing the Patrone,
and finding him guilty of this oppression, belaboured him soundly with handy blowes,
and caused him to deliver my things, carrying me with them five miles to a Towne where
they remained, called Rethenos, formerly Carastia, where I was exceeding kindly entertained
ten dayes: And most nobly (as indeed they were noble) they bestowed on me forty Chickens
of Gold at my departure, for the better advancement of my voyage, which was the first
gift that ever I received in all my travells. For if the darts of death had not beene
more advantagious to me, then Asiaticke gifts, I had never beene able to have undergone
this tributary, tedious, and sumptuous peregrination: The confluence of the divine
providence allotting me meanes, from the losse of my dearest consorts gave me in the
deepnesse of sorrow, a thankefull rejoycing.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The Ile Nigroponti.</i></span>Nigroponti was formerly called Euboea, next, Albantes: and is now surnamed the Queene
of Archipelago: The Turkes cognominate this Ile Egribos: The Towne of Nigropont, from
which the Ile taketh the name, was taken in by Mahomet the second; Anno. 1451. and
in this Ile is found the Amianten stone, which is said to be drawne in threeds, as
out of Flaxe, whereof they make napkins, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103">103</a>]</span>and other like stuffes; and to make it white, they use to throw it in the fire, being
salted: The stone also is found here, called by the Greekes Ophites, and by us Serpentine.
The circuit of this Ile is three hundred fourty sixe miles. It is seperated from the
firme land of Thessalia, from the <span class="right-marginnote">[III. 115.]</span>which it was once rent by an Earthquake, with a narrow channell, over the which in
one place there is a bridge, that passeth betweene the Ile, and the maine continent,
and under it runneth a marvellous swift current, or Euripus, which ebbeth and floweth
sixe times night and day. Within halfe a mile of the bridge, I saw a Marble columne,
standing on the toppe of a little Rocke, whence (as the Ilanders told me) <span class="marginnote"><i>Aristotles death.</i></span>Aristotle leaped in, and drowned himselfe, after that he could not conceive the reason,
why this Channell so ebbed &amp; flowed: using these words, <span lang="la">Quia ego non capio te, tu capias me</span>. This Ile bringeth forth in abundance, all things requisite for humane life, and
decored with many goodly Villages.
</p>
<p>The chiefe Cities are Nigropont, and Calchos: The principall rivers Cyro, and Nelos,
of whom it is sayd, if a sheepe drinke of the former, his wooll becommeth white, if
of the latter coale blacke. From thence and after 22. dayes abode in this Ile, I arrived
at a Towne in Macedonia, called Salonica, but of old Thessalonica, where I stayed
five dayes, and was much made of by the Inhabitants, being Jewes.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Salonica.</i></span>Salonica is situate by the sea side, betweene the two Rivers Chabris and Ehedora:
It is a pleasant, large and magnificke City, full of all sorts of merchandize; and
it is nothing inferiour in all things (except nobility) unto Naples in Italy: It was
sometimes for a while under the Signiory of Venice, till Amurath the sonne of Mahomet,
tooke it from this Reipublicke. And is the principall place of Thessaly which is a
Province of Macedon, together with Achaia, and Myrmedon, which are the other two Provinces
of the same.
</p>
<p>This City of Salonica is now converted in an university for the Jewes; and they are
absolute Signiors thereof <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104">104</a>]</span><span class="right-marginnote">[III. 116.]</span>under the great Turke, with a large Territory of land, lying without and about them:
It hath beene ever in their hands since Soliman tooke in Buda in Hungary, Anno. 1516.
August. 20. to whome they lent two millions of money, and for warrandice whereof,
they have this Towne and Province made fast to them: They speake vulgarly and Maternally
here the Hebrew tongue, man, woman and child, and not else where in all the world.
All their Sinagogian or Leviticall Priests are bred here, and from hence dispersed
to their severall stations.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Thessaly.</i></span>Thessaly a long the sea side, lieth betweene Peloponnesus, and Achaia: Wherein standeth
the hill Olympus, on which Hercules did institute the Olympian games, which institution
was of long time the Grecian Epoche, from whence they reckoned their time.
</p>
<p>Macedon is now called by the Turkes Calethiros, signifying a mighty &amp; warlike Nation:
Macedonia, containing Thessaly, Achaia, and Mirmidon, lieth as a center to them; having
Achaia to the East: Thessalia to the South: Mirmidonia, bordering with Ætolia to the
West: And a part of Hoemus, whence it was called Hæmonia, and some of Misia superior
to the North: It was also called Amathia, from Amathus once King thereof, and then
Macedonia from the King Macedo: The chiefe Cities are Andorista, Andesso, Sydra, Sederaspen,
where the mines of gold and silver be, which enrich the Turke so monethly, receiving
thence somtimes 18000. 24000. &amp; 30000. Ducats. And Pellia, where Alexander the great
was borne. Bajazet the first, wonne this Countrey, from the Constantinopolitans. About
this City of Salonica is the most fertile and populous Countrey in all Greece.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The vicissitude of Greece.</i></span>Greece of all Kingdomes in Europe, hath bene most famous, and highly renowned for
many noble respects: <span class="right-marginnote">[III. 117.]</span>yet most subject to the vicissitude of Fortune than any other: who changing Gold for
Brasse, and loathing their owne Princes, suffered many tyrants to rule over them,
scourging their folly with their fall, and curing a festered soare with a poysoned
playster: whence succeded a dismall <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105">105</a>]</span>discord, which beginning when the State of Greece was at the highest, did not expire
till it fell to the lowest ebbe; sticking fast in the hands of a grievous desolation:
which former times, if a man would retrospectively measure, he might easily find,
and not without admiration, how the mighty power of the divine Majestie doth swey
the moments of things, and sorteth them in peremptory manner to strange and unlooked
for effects: making reason blind, policy astonished, strength feeble, valour dastardly,
turning love into hatred, feare into fury, boldnesse into trembling, and in the circuit
of one minute, making the Conquerour, a conquered person.
</p>
<p>Greece now tearmed by the Turkes Rum-Ili, the Romane Countrey, was first called Helles,
next Grecia of Grecus, who was once King thereof: The Greekes, of all other Gentiles,
were the first converted Christians, and are wonderfull devout in their professed
Religion: The Priests weare the haire of their heads hanging over their shoulders:
These that be the most sincere religious men; abstaine alwayes from eating of flesh
or fish, contenting themselves with water, hearbes, and bread: They differ much in
ceremonies, and principles of Religion from the Papists, and the computation of their
Kalender is as ours.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Foure Patriarchs in the Greekish Church.</i></span>They have foure Patriarkes, who governe the affaires of their Church, and also any
civill dissentions, which happen amongst them, viz. one in Constantinople, another
in Antiochia, the third in Alexandria, &amp; the fourth in Jerusalem. It is not needfull
for me to penetrate further <span class="right-marginnote">[III. 118.]</span>in the condition of their estate, because it is no part of my intent in this Treatise.
In a word, they are wholly degenerate from their Auncestors in valour, vertue, and
learning: Universities they have none, and civill behaviour is quite lost: formerly
in derision they tearmed all other Nations Barbarians: A name now most fit for themselves,
being the greatest dissembling lyers, inconstant, and uncivill people of all other
Christians in the World.

</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>False testimonie of vagabonding Greekes.</i></span>By the way, I must give the Kings Kingdomes a caveat here, concerning vagabonding
Greekes, and their counterfeit Testimonials: True it is, there is no such matter,
as these lying Rascals report unto you, concerning their Fathers, their Wives, and
Children taken Captives by the Turke: O damnable invention! How can the Turke prey
upon his owne Subjects, under whom, they have as great Liberty, save onely the use
of Bels, as we have under our Princes: The tyth of their Male children, being absolutely
abrogated by Achmet, this Amuraths Father; and the halfe also of their Female Dowry
at Marriages: And farre lesse for Religion, can they be banished, or deprived of their
Benefices, as some false and dissembling fellowes, under the Title of Bishops make
you beleeve; There being a free Liberty of Conscience, for all kinds of Religion,
through all his Dominions, as well for us free borne Frankes as for them, and much
more them, the Greekes, Armenians, Syriacks, Amoronits, Coptics, Georgians, or any
other Orientall sort of Christians: And therefore looke to it, that you be no more
gulled, golding them so fast as you have done, least for your paines, you prove greater
Asses, than they do Knaves.

<p>In Salonica I found a Germo, bound for Tenedos, in which I imbarked: As we sayled

manure. A little more East-ward, as we fetcht up the coast of Achaia, the maister
of the vessell shewed me a ruinous village, and castle, where he sayd the admired
<span class="marginnote"><i>Thebes.</i></span>Citty of Thebes had bene. Whose former glory, who can truely write of; for as the
earth, when she is disroabed of her budding and fructifying trees, and of her amiable
verdure, which is her onely grace and garment royall, is like a naked table wherein
nothing is painted: even so is Thebes and her past tryumphs defac&#x2019;d, and bereft of
her lusty and young Gentlemen, as if the spring-tide had bene taken from the yeare:
But what shall I say to know the cause of such like things, they are so secret and
mysticall; being the most remote objects, to which our understanding may aspire, that
we may easily be deceived, by disguised and <span class="right-marginnote">[III. 120.]</span>pretended reasons; whilst we seeke for the true and essentiall causes: for to report
things that are done is easie, because the eye and the tongue may dispatch it, but
to discover and unfold the causes of things, requireth braine, soule, and the best
progresse of nature. And as there is no evill without excuse, nor no pretence without
some colour of reason, nor wiles wanting to malicious and wrangling wits; Even so,
was there occasion sought for, what from Athens, and what from Greece, whereby the
peace and happinesse of Thebes might be dissolved, and discord raised to the last
ruines of her desolation.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Geographicall errours.</i></span>This Achaia is by some ignorant Geographers placed in the middle betweene Epire, Thessaly,
and Peloponesus: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108">108</a>]</span>where contrariwise it is the Eastmost Province of Greece except Thrace, lying along
twixt it and Thessaly by the sea side, which part of the Countrey, some late Authors
have falsly named Migdonia, which is a Province, that lieth North from Thracia, East
from Macedon, and South from Misia, having no affinity with the Sea: The chiefe Citties
in Achaia, are Neapolis, Appollonia, and Nicalide where the famous Philosophers Aristotle
was borne: Here is a huge and high Hill Athos, containing in circuit 70. miles, and
as some affirme three dayes journey long, whose shaddow was absurdly sayd to have
extended to Lemnos, an Iland lying neere the Carpathian Sea.
</p>
<p>Achaia was formerly called Aylaide, but now by the Turkes Levienda: Athos in Greeke
is called Agios æros, to wit, a holy Mountaine; the top of it is halfe a dayes journey
broad, and 14. Italian miles high. There are twenty Monasteries upon it of Greekish
Coleires, a laborious kind of silly Friers, and kind to Strangers: The chiefest of
which Cloisters, are called Victopodos, and Agios laura, being all of them strongly
walled and fensible.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[III. 121.]</span>Upon the third day from Salonica, we arrived in the Roade of Tenedos, which is an
Iland in the Sea Pontus, or Propontis: It hath a City called Tenedos, built by Tenes,
which is a gallant place, having a Castle, and a faire Haven for all sorts of vessells:
It produceth good store of wines, and the best supposed to be in all the South east
parts of Europe, or yet in Asia. The Iland is not bigge, but exceeding fertile, lying
three miles from the place where Troy stood, as Virgil reported, Æneid. 2.

who had lost their ship at Sio, when they were busie at venereall tilting, with their
new elected Mistresses, and for a second remedy, were glad to come thither in a Turkish
Carmoesalo. The like of this I have seene fall out with Seafaring men, Merchants,
and Passengers, who buy sometimes their too much folly, with too deare a repentance.
They and I resolving to view Troy, did hire a Jenisarie to be our conductor and protector,
and a Greeke to be our Interpreter. <span class="right-marginnote">[III. 122.]</span>Where when we landed, we saw here and there many relicts of old walles, as we travelled
through these famous bounds. And as we were advanced toward the East part of Troy,
our Greeke brought us to many <span class="marginnote"><i>The Tombes of Trojanes.</i></span>Tombes, which were mighty ruinous, and pointed us particularly to the Tombes of Hector,
Ajax, Achilles, Troylus, and many other valiant Champions, with the Tombes also of
Hecuba, Cresseid, and other Trojane Dames: Well I wot, I saw infinite old Sepulchers,
but for their particular names, and nomination of them, I suspend, neither could I
beleeve my Interpreter, sith it is more then three thousand and odde yeares agoe,
that Troy was destroyed.

of Æneas dwelt. At the North-east corner of Troy, which is in sight of the Castles
of Hellesponte, there is a gate yet standing, and a peece of a reasonable high wall;
upon which I found three peeces of rusted money, which afterward I gave two of them
to the younger brethren of the Duke of Florence, then studying in Pretolino: The other

The length of Troy hath been, as may be discerned, by the fundamentall walls yet extant,
about twenty Italian miles, which I reckon to be ten Scottish or fifteene English
miles; lying along the sea side betweene the three Papes of Ida, and the furthest

his brother Jasius, fled to this Countrey, and first erected it, intituling it Dardania:
Next it was called Troy of Tros, from whom the Countrey was also named Troas: It was
also termed <span class="right-marginnote">[III. 125.]</span>Ilion of Ilus, who built the Regall pallace surnamed Ilium: This City was taken and
defaced by Hercules, and the Greecians, in the time of Laomedon, himselfe being killed
the latter time: Lastly, Troy was reedified by Priamus, who giving leave to his sonne
Paris to ravish Helena, Menalaus wife, enforced the Greekes to renew the auncient
quarrell: Where after 10. yeares siege the Towne was utterly subverted, Anno Mundi

that which I had given, the wrathfull Janisary belaboured them both with a cudgell,
till the bloud sprung from their heads, and compelled them to double his wages. This
is one true note to a Traveller (whereof I had the full experience afterward) that
if he cannot make his owne part good, he must alwayes at the first motion content
these Rascals; otherwise he will be constrained, doubtlesse, with stroakes, to pay
twice as much: for they make no account of conscience, nor ruled by the Law of compassion,
neither regard they a Christian more than a dogge: but whatsoever extortion or injury
they use against him, he must be French-like contented, bowing his head, and making
a counterfeit shew of thankes, and happy too oftentimes, if so he escape.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Sestos and Abydos.</i></span>Hence we arrived at the Castles, called of olde Sestos, and Abydos, in a small Frigot,
which are two Fortresses opposite to other: Sestos in Europe where Thracia beginneth;
and Abidos in Asia where Bithinia likewise commenceth, being a short mile distant,
and both of them foure leagues from Troy. They stand at the beginning of Hellespont,
and were also cognominate the Castles of Hiero and Leander, which were erected in
a commemoration of their admirable fidelity in love.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Which curling tops, Leander cut in two,

</p>
<p class="line">The angry Fates, did kind Leander drowne:
</p>
<p class="line">Of which when Hiero heard, judge you her part,
</p>
<p class="line">She smote her selfe, and rent in two her heart.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">But now they are commonly called the Castles of Gallipoly; yea, or rather the strength
of Constantinople, betweene which no Shippes may enter, without knowledge of the Captaines,
and are by them strictly and warily searched, least the Christians should carry in
Men, Munition, or furniture of Armes, for they stand in feare of surprising the Towne:
And at their returne they must stay three dayes, before they are permitted to go through,
because of transporting away any Christian slaves, or if they have committed any offence
in the Citty, the knowledge thereof may come in that time.
</p>
<p>At that same instant of my abode at Abidos, there were fourescore Christian slaves,
who having cut their Captaines throat, with the rest of the Turkes, <span class="marginnote"><i>Christian slaves fled from Constantinople.</i></span>runne away from Constantinople with the Galley. And passing here the second day thereafter
at midnight, were discovered by the watch of both Castles, where the Cannon never
left thundring for two houres; yet they escaped with small hurt, and at last arrived
in the Road of Zante; desiring landing, &amp; succour, for their victuals were done: victuals
they sent them, but the Governour would not suffer them to come on Land. In end, the
Sea growing somewhat boysterous, the slaves for an excuse cut their Cables, and runne
the Galley a shoare: Upon this they were entertained in service, but the Providitor
caused to burne the Galley, fearing least the Turkes should thereby forge some quarrell.
The yeare following, an other Galley attempted the same, but the poore slaves having
past the Castles, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114">114</a>]</span><span class="right-marginnote">[III. 128.]</span>had bene so wounded and killed with the great shot, and the Galley ready to sinke,
they were enforced to runne a shoare, where the next morning being apprehended, they
were miserably put to death. Betwixt the Castles and Constantinople, is about fourty
leagues. Over this straite Xerxes did make a bridge of boates to passe into Greece,
which when a sudden tempest had shrewdly battered, he caused the sea to be beaten
with 300. stripes.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The sorrow of Xerxes.</i></span>And at that same time Xerxes passing over the Hellespont, and seeing all the sea cled
with his Army, his Horses, Chariots, and Ships, the teares burst from his eyes: and
being demanded the cause of his griefe? answered, O, sayd he, I weepe because within
a hundreth yeares, all this great and glorious sight, shall be dissolved to nothing;
and neither man, nor beast shall be alive, nor Chariot, nor Engine of Warre, but shall
be turn&#x2019;d to dust; and so I sorrow to see the short mortality of Nature. Indeed it
was a worthy saying, from such a Heathnish Monarch, who saw no further, than the present
misery of this life.
</p>
<p>Here I left the two French men with a Greeke Barbour, and imbarked for Constantinople,
in a Turkish Frigato. The first place of any note I saw, within these narrow Seas,
was the auncient Citty of Gallipolis, the second seate of Thracia, which was first
builded by Caius Caligula, and sometimes had beene inhabited by the Gaules: It was
the first Towne in Europe, that the Turkes conquered; and was taken by Solyman sonne
to Orchanes, Anno 1438.
</p>
<p>North from Thracia lyeth the Province of Bulgaria commonly Volgaria, and was called
so of certaine people, that came from a countrey, neere to the River Volgo in Russia,
about the yeare 666. It lieth betweene Servia, Thracia, and Danubio, and by the Auncients,
it was <span class="right-marginnote">[III. 129.]</span>thought to be the lower Mysia (but more justly the Region of Dacia.) The chiefe Towne
is Sophia, which some hold to be that Towne, which Ptolomeus named Tibisca.
</p>
<p>Here in Thracia lived the Tyrant Polymnestor, who <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115">115</a>]</span>treacherously murthered Polidorus a yonger sonne of Priamus: For which fact Hecuba,
the young Princes mother scratched him to death. Here also reigned the worthy King
Cotis, whom I propose as a paterne of rare temper, in maistering and preventing passion:
To whom when a neighbour Prince had sent him an exquisite present, of accurately wrought
glasses; he (having dispatched the messenger with all due complements and gratitude
of Majestie) broke them all to peeces: Least by mishappe, any of his Servants doing
the like, might stirre or move him to an intemperate choller.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Mount Athos.</i></span>The Greekes here, and generally through all Greece, beare as much reverence and respect
to Mount Athos, as the Papists beare to Rome: All of which Religious Coliers or Friers,
must toyle and labour for their living, some in the Vines, some in the Corne-fields,
and others at home in their Monasteries, or else where abroad, are alwayes occupied
for the mainteining of their Families: They are but poorely cled, yet wonderfull kinde
to all Viadants; so that who so have occasion to passe that Mountaine, are there lodged,
and furnished of all necessary provision of food, by these sequestrat or solitary
livers, whose simple and harmelesse lives, may be tearmed to be the very Emblemes
of Piety and Devotion; knowing nothing but to serve God, and to live soberly in their
carriage.
</p>
<p>The chiefest Cities of Thrace, are Constantinople, Abdera, where Democritus was borne,
who spent his life <span class="right-marginnote">[III. 130.]</span>in laughing, Sestos, Gallipoli, Trajanople, Galata, and Adrianopolis, which was taken
by Bajazet, Anno. 1362.
</p>
<p>As we sayled betweene Thracia and Bithinia, a learned Grecian brought up in Padua
that was in my company, shewed me Colchis, whence Jason, with the assistance of the
Argonautes, and the aide of Medeas skill, did fetch the golden fleece. <span class="marginnote"><i>The Sea Hellespont.</i></span>This Sea Hellespont tooke the name of Helle daughter to Athamas King of Thebes, who
was here drowned; and of the Countrey Pontus, joyning to the same Sea, wherein are
these three Countries, Armenia <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116">116</a>]</span>minor, Colchis, and Cappadocia. After we had fetcht up the famous City of Calcedon
in Bithinia on our right hand; I beheld on our left hand, the Prospect of that little
World, the great City of Constantinople; which indeed yeeldeth such an outward splendor
to the amazed beholder, of goodly Churches, stately Towers, gallant Steeples, and
other such things, whereof now the World make so great accompt, that the whole earth
cannot equall it. Beholding these delectable objects, we entred in the channell of
Bosphorus, which divideth Perah from Constantinople. And arriving at Tapanau, where
all the munition of the great Turke lyeth, I adressed my selfe to a Greeke lodging,
to refresh my selfe till morning.
</p>
<p>But (by your leave) I had a hard welcome in my landing, for bidding farewell to the
Turkes, who had kindly used me three dayes, in our passage from the Castles, the Maister
of the boate saying, adio Christiano: There were foure French Runnagats standing on
the Kaye; <span class="marginnote"><i>A harsh arrivall.</i></span>who hearing these words, fell desperatly upon me, blaspheming the name of Jesus, and
throwing me to the ground, beate me most cruelly: And if it had not beene for my friendly
Turkes, who leaped out of their boate and relieved me, I had doubtlesse there <span class="right-marginnote">[III. 131.]</span>perished. The other Infidells standing by, said to me, behold what a Saviour thou
hast, when these that were Christians, now turned Mahometans, cannot abide, nor regard
the name of thy God; having left them, with many a shrewd blow, they had left me,
I entred a Greeke lodging, where I was kindly received; and much eased of my blowes,
because they caused to oynt them with divers Oyles, and refreshed me also with their
best entertainement, gratis, because I had suffered so much for Christs sake, and
would receive no recompense againe. The day following, I went to salute, and doe my
duety to the right Worshipfull Sir Thomas Glover, then Lord Ambassadour for our late
Gratious Soveraigne King James, of blessed memory, who most generously &amp; courteously
entertained me three moneths in his house, to whose <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117">117</a>]</span>kindnesses I was infinitely obliged: as hereafter in my following discourse of the

founded by the Lacedemonians, who were conducted from Lacedemon, by one Pausanias,

to the neighbouring Perinthians. This Citie thus <span class="right-marginnote">[IV. 133.]</span>remained in calamitie, <span class="marginnote"><i>Bizantium reedified by Constantine.</i></span>till Constantine (resigning the City of Rome, and a great part of Italy to the Popish
inheritance or the Romane Bishops) reedified the same, and translated his Imperiall
seate in the East, and reduced all the Empire of Greece, to a unite tranquilitie,
with immortall reputation, which the Parthians and Persians had so miserably disquieted.
</p>
<p>But these disorders at length reformed by the severe administration of Justice, for
the which, and other worthy respects, the said Constantine sonne of Saint Helen, and
Emperour of Rome (which afterward the Pope usurped) was surnamed the Great. He first
in his plantation called this Citie new Rome; but when he beheld the flourishing,
and multiplying of all things in it, and because of the commodious situation thereof,
he called it Constantinoplis, after his owne name. This Emperour lived there many
prosperous yeares, in most happy estate: likewise many of his successors did, untill
such time, that Mahomet the second of that name, and Emperour of the Turkes; living
in a discontented humour to behold the great and glorious dominions of Christians;
especially this famous Citie, that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120">120</a>]</span>so flourished in his eyes, by momentall circumstances, collected his cruell intentions,
to the full height of ambition; whereby he might abolish the very name of Christianity,
and also puft up with a presumptuous desire, to inlarge his Empire, went with a marvellous
power, both by Sea and Land, unto this magnificent Mansion.
</p>
<p>The issue whereof was such, that after divers batteries and assaults, the irreligious
Infidels broke downe the walles, and entred the City, which breach was about forty
<span class="right-marginnote">[IV. 134.]</span>paces long, as by the new colour being built up againe, is easily knowne from the
old walles: where when they entered, they made a wonderfull massacre of poore afflicted
Christians, without sparing any of the Romane kinde, either male or female. In the
mercilesse fury of these Infernall Impes, the Emperour Constantine was killed, whose
head being cut off, was carried upon the point of a Launce through all the City, and
Campe of the Turkes, to the great disgrace and ignominy of Christianity. His Empresse,
Daughters, and other Ladies after they were abused in their bodyes, were put to death
in a most cruell and terrible manner.
</p>
<p>By this overthrow of Constantinople, this Mahomet tooke twelve Kingdomes, and two
hundred Cities from the Christians, which is a lamentable losse, of such an illustrious
Empire. Thus was that imperiall Citie lost, in the yeare 1453. May 29. when it had
remained under the government of Christians, 1198. yeares. It is now the chiefe abode
of the great Turke Sultan Achmet, the fifteene Grand Cham, or the line of Ottoman,
who was then about twenty three yeares of age; whose sonne <span class="marginnote"><i>Foure Emperours one after another distressed.</i></span>Osman since, and after his death, was murdered by the Janizaries, being 14. yeares
of age, after his returne to Constantinople from Podolia in Polland: And in his place,
his Unkle Mustaffa made Emperour, whose weaknesse and unworthinesse being eft soones
discoverd, he was displaced, and Amurath Osmans brother made Grand Signior, who presently
raigneth, and not without great feare of his Janizaries and Timariots, who twice in
three <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121">121</a>]</span>yeares have lately made insurrection against him. This Emperour Achmet, who was alive
when I was there, was more given to venery, then martialitie, which gave a greater
advantage to the Persians in their defensive Warres.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[IV. 135.]</span>Concerning the Empire, we may observe some fatall contrarieties in one and the same
name: For Phillip the Father of Alexander, layd the first foundation of the Macedonian
Monarchy, and Phillip the Father of Perseus ruined it. <span class="marginnote"><i>Contrarieties of fortune.</i></span>So was this Towne built by a Constantine, the Sonne of Helena, a Gregory being Patriarch;
and was lost by a Constantine, the sonne of a Helena, a Gregory being also Patriarch.
The Turkes have a Prophecy, that as it was wonne by a Mahomet, so it shall be lost
by a Mahomet.
</p>
<p>The forme, or situation of this Citty, is like unto a Triangle, the South part whereof,
and the East part, are invironed with Hellespontus, and Bosphorus Thraicus; and the
North part adjoyning to the firme land. It is in compasse about the walles, esteemed
to be eighteene miles: in one of these triangled points, being the South-east part,
and at the joyning of Bosphore and Hellespont, standeth the Pallace of the Great Turke,
called Seralia, and the Forrest wherein he hunteth; which is two miles in length.
</p>
<p>The speciall object of Antiquity, I saw within this Citty, was the incomparable Church
of Saint Sophia, whose ornaments and hallowed vessels, were innumerable in the time
of Justinian the Emperour, who first builded it; but now converted to a Moskuee, and
consecrate to Mahomet, after a diabolicall manner.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Hyppodrome.</i></span>I saw also the famous Hyppodrome, and the Theater whereon the people stood, when the
Emperours used to runne their Horses, and make their Princely shewes on solemne dayes,
which is now altogether decayd: There is a great Columne in that same place, in the
which all these things memorable, that have bene done in this Hyppodrome, are superficially
carved.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122">122</a>]</span>
</p>
<p>Upon the West corner of the Citty, there is a strong Fortresse, fortified with seaven
great Towers, and well <span class="right-marginnote">[IV. 136.]</span>furnished with Munition, called by Turkes, Jadileke: In this Prison, are Bassawes,
and Subbassawes imprisoned, and also great men of Christians, if any offence be committed.
Their place of Exchange is called Bezastan, wherein all sorts of commodities are to
be sold; as Sattins, Silkes, Velvets, Cloth of Silver and Gold, and the most exquisitely
wrought Hand-kerchiefes, that can be found in the world; with infinite other commodities,
the relation of which would be tedious.
</p>
<p>I have seene men and women as usually sold here in Markets, as Horses and other beasts
are with us: The most part of which are Hungarians, Transilvanians, Carindians, Istrians,
and Dalmatian Captives, and of other places besides, which they can overcome. Whom,
if no compassionable Christian will buy, or relieve; then must they either turne Turke,
or be addicted to perpetuall slavery. Here I remember of a charitable deede, done
for a sinfull end, and thus it was; A Ship of Marseilles, called the great Dolphin,
lying here forty dayes at the Galata, <span class="marginnote"><i>A French palliard.</i></span>the Maister Gunner, named Monsieur Nerack, and I falling in familiar acquaintance,
upon a time he told me secretly that he would gladly for Conscience and Merits sake,
redeeme some poore Christian slave from Turkish Captivity. To the which, I applauded
his advice, and told him the next Friday following I would assist him to so worthy
an action: Friday comes, and he and I went for Constantinople, where the Market of
the slaves being ready, we spent two houres in viewing, and reviewing five hundreth
Males and Females. At last I pointed him to have bought an old man or woman, but his
minde was contrary set, shewing me that he would buy some virgin, or young widdow,
to save their bodies undefloured with Infidels. The price of a virgin was too deare
for <span class="right-marginnote">[IV. 137.]</span>him, being a hundred Duckets, and widdows were farre under, and at an easier rate:
When we did visite and search them that we were mindfull to buy, they were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123">123</a>]</span>strip&#x2019;d starke naked before our eyes, where the sweetest face, the youngest age, and
whitest skin was in greatest value and request: The Jewes sold them, for they had
bought them from the Turkes: At last we fell upon a Dalmatian widdow, whose pittifull
lookes, and sprinkling teares, stroke my soule almost to the death for compassion:
whereupon I grew earnest for her reliefe, and he yeelding to my advice, she is bought
and delivered unto him, the man being 60. yeares of age, and her price 36. Duckets.
We leave the market and came over againe to Galata, where he and I tooke a Chamber
for her, and leaving them there, the next morning I returned earely, suspecting greatly
the dissembling devotion of the Gunner to be nought but luxurious lust, and so it
proved: I knocked at the Chamber doore, that he had newly locked, and taken the key
with him to the ship, for he had tarried with her all that night; and she answering
me with teares, told me all the manner of his usage, wishing her selfe to be againe
in her former captivity: whereupon I went a shipboord to him, &amp; in my griefe I swore,
that if he abused her any more after that manner, and not returned to her distresse,
her Christian liberty; I would first make it knowne to his Maister the Captaine of
the ship, and then to the French Ambassadour: for he was mindfull also, his lust being
satisfied to have sold her over againe to some other: At which threatning the old
Pallyard became so fearefull, that he entred in a reasonable condition with me, and
the ship departing thence sixe dayes thereafter, he freely resigned to me her life,
her liberty and freedome: which being done, and he gone, under <span class="right-marginnote">[IV. 138.]</span>my hand before divers Greekes, I <span class="marginnote"><i>The Dalmatian Widdow relieved.</i></span>subscribed her libertie, and hyr&#x2019;d her in the same Taverne for a yeare, taking nothing
from her, for as little had she to give me, except many blessings and thankefull prayers:
This French Gunner was a Papist, and heare you may behold the dregs of his devotion,
and what seven nights leachery cost him, you may cast up the reckoning of 36. Duckets.
</p>
<p>In Constantinople there have happened many fearefull <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124">124</a>]</span>fires, which often hath consumed to ashes the most part of the rarest Monuments there,
and the beauty of infinite Pallaces; as Zonoras the Constantinopolitan Historiographer
in his Histories mentioneth. And now lately in the yeare 1607. October 14. there were
burned above 3000. houses, of which I saw a number of ruines (as yet) <span class="marginnote"><i>Pestilence and Earth quakes.</i></span>unrepaired. It is subject also to divers Earth quakes, which have often subverted
the Towers, Houses, Churches, and Walles of the City to the ground. Especially in
the yeare 1509. in the raigne of Bajazeth, the ninth Emperour of the Turkes, in which
time, more then 13000. persons were all smothered and dead, and laid up in heapes
unburied. And commonly every third yeare, the pestilence is exceeding great in that
City, and after such an odious manner; that those who are infected (before they die)
have the halfe of their one side rot, and fall away: so that you may easily discerne
the whole intrailes of their bowels. It is not licentiated here, nor else where in
all Turkey, that any Christian should enter in their Moskies, or Churches, without
the conduct of a Janisary; the tryall whereof I had when I viewed that glorious and
great Church of Sancta Sophia, once the beauty and ornament of all Europe; and is
now the chiefe place, to which the Great Turke or Emperour goeth every Friday, their
Sabboth day to doe his devotion, being accompanied with 3000. Janisaries, besides
Bashawes, <span class="right-marginnote">[IV. 139.]</span>Chowses and Hagars. Truely I may say of Constantinople, as I said once of the world,
in the Lamentado of my second Pilgrimage;
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">A painted Whoore, the maske of deadly sin,
</p>
<p class="line">Sweet faire without, and stinking foule within.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">For indeed outwardly it hath the fairest show, and inwardly in the streets being narrow,
and most part covered, the filthiest &amp; deformed buildings in the world; the reason
of its beauty, is, because being situate on moderate prospective heights, the universall
tectures, a farre off, yeeld a delectable show, the covertures being <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125">125</a>]</span>erected like the backe of a Coach after the Italian fashion with gutterd tyle. But
being entred within, there is nothing but a stinking deformity, and a loathsome contrived
place; without either internall domesticke furniture, or externall decorements of
fabricks palatiatly extended. Notwithstanding that for its situation, the delicious
wines, &amp; fruits, the temperate climat, the fertile circumjacent fields, and for the
Sea Hellespont, and pleasant Asia on the other side: it may truely be called the Paradice
of the earth.
</p>
<p>Perah is over against Constantinople, called of old, Cornubizantii; but by the Turkes,
Galata, being both a quarter of a mile distant, and the Thraick Bosphore dividing
the two. It is the place at which Christian Ships touch, and where <span class="marginnote"><i>The Christian Ambassadours at Perah.</i></span>the Ambassadours of Christendome lie. The number of the Christian Ambassadours that
then lay there, and now doe, were these, first the Romane Emperours, then the French,
thirdly the English, fourthly the Venetian, and lastly the Holland Ambassadours, with
whom often for discourses I was familiar, although with Noble Sir Thomas Glover I
was still domestick for 12. weekes, whose Secretary for that time was my Countrey
man, Maister James Rollocke, who now, as I take it, is resident in Striveling; he
was the last Scotsman I saw till my returne to Malta after my departure from Constantinople.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[IV. 140.]</span>From thence I went to the blacke Sea: but commonly Mare Euxinum, where I saw <span class="marginnote"><i>Pompeyes Pillar.</i></span>Pompeyes Pillar of Marble, standing neere the shoare, upon a rocky Iland: and not
far from thence, is a Lanthorne higher then any Steeple, whereon there is a panne
full of liquor, that burneth every night to give warning unto ships how neare they
come the shore; It is not much unlike these Lanthornes of Ligorne and Genua. The water
of this Sea is never a whit blacker then other Seas: but it is called blacke, in respect
of the dangerous events in darke and tempestuous nights, which happen there; and because
of the Rockes and Sands which lye a great way from the maine <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126">126</a>]</span>shore: upon which many vessels many times are cast away. The blacke Sea is not farre
from Galata, for I both went and returned in one day, being forty miles out, and in:
For I went by boate, and not by land, through the pleasant Euripus, that runneth betweene
the Euxine Sea and Hellespont: And by the way, I cannot but regrate, the great losse
Sir Thomas Glover received by the Duke of Moldavia, who chargeably entertained him
two yeares in his house, and furnished him with great moneys, and other necessaries
fit for his eminency: This Duke or Prince of Bugdonia was depraved of his Principalities
by Achmet, and fled hither to the Christian Ambassadours for reliefe: To whom when
all the rest had refus&#x2019;d acceptance, onely Noble Sir Thomas received him, maintained
him, and seriously wrought with the Grand Signior and his Counsell, to have had him
restored againe to his Lands, but could not prevaile.
</p>
<p>In the end, Sir Thomas Glovers five yeares time of Ambassodry being expired, and the
Duke hearing privately that Sir Paul Pinder was to come in his place, as indeede he
came too soone: this Moldavian Prince stole earely <span class="right-marginnote">[IV. 141.]</span>away in the morning over to Constantinople; and <span class="marginnote"><i>The Duke of Moldavia turnd Turke.</i></span>long or midday turnd Turke, and was circumcised, contenting himselfe onely for all
his great Dukedome, with a Palace, and a yearely pension of twelve thousand Chickens
of Gold during his life. Which, when we heard, the Ambassadour, and we were all amazed
and discontented: He was indebted to the Ambassadour above 15. thousand Chickens of
Gold, yet or my leaving Galata, I went twice over with Sir Thomas, and saw him, and
found him attended with a number of Turkes, who when he saw me, tooke me kindly by
the hand, for we had bene two moneths familiar in the Ambassadors house before.
</p>
<p>The English Ambassador within halfe a yeare, recovered the halfe of his moneys, the
other halfe he was forced to forgoe for diverse importunate respects. Nay, I must
say one thing more of this Knight, he releeved more slaves from the Galleys, payd
their ransomes, and sent <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127">127</a>]</span>them home freely to their Christian stations, and kept a better house, than any Ambassadour
did, that ever lay at Constantinople, or ever shall to the worlds end.
</p>
<p>His mother was a Pollonian, who comming from Dansicke to London, was delivered of
him upon the Sea: Afterward he was brought up at Constantinople from a boy, and spoke,
and wrot the Slavonian Tongue perfectly: And thence returning for London, he was the
first Ambassador King James, of blessed Memory, sent to Constantinople, after his
comming to the Crowne of England: And this much for this worthy and ever renowned
Knight, whose prayse and fame I cannot too much celebrate.
</p>
<p>The Turkes have no Bels in their Churches, neither the use of a clocke, nor numbring
of houres, but they have high round Steeples, for they contrafact, and contradict
all the formes of Christians: when they goe to pray, <span class="right-marginnote">[IV. 142.]</span>they are called together by the voyce of crying men, who goe upon the bartizings of
their Steeples, shouting and crying with a shrill voyce: La illa, Eillalla, Mahomet
Rezul allah, that is: God is a great God, and Mahomet is his Prophet, or otherwise
there is but one God.
</p>
<p>In Constantinople, and all other places of Turky, I ever saw three Sabboths together,
in one weeke: The Friday for the Turkes, the Saturday for Jewes, and the Sunday for
Christians: but the Turkes Sabboth is worst kept of all: for they will not spare to
do any labour on their Holy Day. They have meetings at their publicke Prayers, <span class="marginnote"><i>Times of Turkish prayers.</i></span>every day five severall times: the first is, before the rising of the Sunne: The second
is, a little before midday: The third is, at three of the clocke in the afternoone:
The fourth is, at the Sunne-setting, Sommer and Winter: Fifthly, the last howre of
Prayer, is alwayes two or three howres within night. Many of them will watch till
that time, and not sleepe; and others sleeping, will awake at the voyce of the Cryer,
and go to Church.
</p>
<p>In signe of reverence, and in a superstitious devotion, before they go into their
Mosquees, they wash themselves in a Lavotoio, beginning at the privy members, next
their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128">128</a>]</span>mouthes faces, feete and hands: And entring, they incline their heads downeward to
the earth; and falling on their knees, do kisse the ground three times. Then the Talasumany,
which is the chiefe Priest, mounteth upon a high stone, where he maketh many Orations
to Mahomet: and the rest to assist him, continue a long time shaking their heads,
as though they were out of all their naturall understanding, repeating oft this word
Haylamo, Haylamo; and after that will sigh grievously, saying, Houpek. And sometimes
will abruptly sing the Psalmes of David in the Arabick tongue, but to no sense, nor
verity of <span class="right-marginnote">[IV. 143.]</span>the Scriptures. And at their devotion, they will not tollerate any women in their
company, lest they should withdraw their minds and affections from their present zeale:
But the men observe their turnes and times, and the women theirs, going alwayes when
they goe, either of them alone to their devotion: The like custome, but not after
the same manner have I seene observed among the Protestants in Transilvania, Hungaria,
Moravia, Bohemia, and Silesia, who when they come to Church on the Sabboth day, there
is a Taffaty Curtaine drawne from the Pulpit to the Church wall over against it: The
men sitting on the right hand of the Preacher, the women on the left; whose eyes and
faces cannot see other during divine Service, save only the Minister that over-toppeth
both sides; and truly me thought it was a very modest, and necessary observation.
<span class="marginnote"><i>The Turkes are circumcised.</i></span>The Turks are generally circumcised after the manner of the Jewes, but not after 8.
dayes, but after 8. yeares. The Church men are called Hadach Casseis, or Darvises,
who weare on their heads greene Shashes, to make distinction betweene them and others:
for they are accounted to be of Mahomets kindred.
</p>
<p>They hold all mad men in great reverence, as Prophets or Saints, &amp; if they intend
any far journey, privat purposes, or otherwise, before they go to battell, they come
to crave counsell of these Santones, to know if they shall prosper, or not, in their
attempts. And whatsoever answer these Bedleem Prophets give, it is holden to be so
credible, as if <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129">129</a>]</span>an Oracle had spoken it. The Turkish Priests are for the most part Moores, whom they
account to be a base people in respect of themselves, calling them Totseks: Their
principall Church governour is called Mufti, Whose definitive sentence in Lawe or
Religion is penetrable, and <span class="right-marginnote">[IV. 144.]</span>absolutely valiant: Neither abaseth he himselfe to sit in the Divano, nor affordeth
more reverence to the Emperour, than he to him. <span class="marginnote"><i>The Turkish Church-men.</i></span>The other sort of Church-men are the Naipi or young Doctors, the Caddi, whereof there
is two or three in every Citty to judge the offences; the Calsi or Readers, and the
Mudressi which use to oversee the Cadeis in their Office: They were all formerly Idolatrous
Pagans, and were fast initiated in Mahometanisme, when they got the Soveraignty of
the Persian Scepter; by the great Battell, and fortunate conduct of Tangrolipix in
overthrowing Mahomet a Saracenicall Sultan of Persia; who inthronized himselfe, in
the Persian Chayre of Estate, Anno 1030. This prerogative Title of Mufti, was first
intituled Caliph, whose residence was in Babylon, and wholly supreme over the Mahometans:
But the Ægyptians after the death of Mot adi Bila, withdrew themselves from this Babylonian
obedience, and choosed one of their owne, to whom the Moores of Barbary submitted
themselves.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Babylon recovered by the Persians.</i></span>But now since Bagdat, or Babylon hath beene recovered by the Persians, about foure
yeares agoe, their Mahometanicall Mufti or Caliph, that then was Resident there, is
now retired to Constantinople, where he sitteth in a more securer place, thinking
rather to follow the Grandeur of the Turke, than the broken Estate of the Persian,
whence I may truly say, he is Fortunes Page, that favoureth them most, who have most
favourers.
</p>
<p>This unwealdy body having two heads, began to decline; for Allan a Tartarian Captaine,
starved Mustatzem the last divided Babylonian Caliph to death and rooted out all his
posterity: And then Sarancon the first Turkish King in Ægypt, brained the last Ægyptian
Caliph with his Mace, leaving none of the issue, or Kindred <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130">130</a>]</span>surviving. The Office of the Caliph is now executed in <span class="right-marginnote">[IV. 145.]</span>Turkey, under the name Muphti, or high Priest. All Turkes do detest the colour of
blacke, and thinke those that weare it, shall never enter into Paradise: But the colour
of greatest request among them is greene; wherewith if any Christian be apparrelled,
he shall be sure of Bastinadoes, and other punishments: Neither may he use the name
of their Prophet Mahomet in his mouth, (under the paine of a cruell censure to be
inflicted upon him) whom they so much adore, and honour.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Mahomets birth.</i></span>This Mahomet was borne, Anno Dom. 591. in Itraripia, a beggarly Village in Arabia,
whose father was Abdillas, an Ismaelite; and his mother Cadiges, a Jew; both different
in Religion, and also of diverse Countries: In his youth he was partly taught the
Judaicall Law, and partly the superstition of the Gentiles. Many alleadge his parentage
was never knowne (being so base) untill his riper yeares bewrayed the same, I also
learned that his Parents dyed whiles he was a young child, and was turned over to
his Unckle, who afterward sold him to one Abdeminoples, a Merchant in Palestina: And
he, after a little time, having remarked his ready and prompt wit, sent him downe
to Ægypt, to be a Factor in his Merchandise; where, by his dissimulate behaviour,
he crept in favour with Christians, Jewes, and Gentiles. He was in proportion of a
meane stature, lively faced, big-headed, eloquent in language, of a sanguinicall complexion,
and a couragious stomacke, in all attempts exceeding desperate: he was also deceitfull,
variant, and fradulent, as may appeare in his Satanicall Fables, expressed in his
Alcoran, where oft one saying contradicteth another, both in words, and effect.
</p>
<p>About this time there was one Sergius, an Italian borne, banished from Constantinople,
because he allowed of the <span class="right-marginnote">[IV. 146.]</span>Arrian sect; who afterward came to Palestina, and frequenting the house of Abdeminoples,
fell in acquaintance with the young man Mahomet; and this Frier perceiving the aspiring
quicknes of his braine, bore a great affection <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131">131</a>]</span>
</p>
<p>to his naturall perfections. Shortly after this, his Maister dying without heires,
and his Mistresse enjoying many rich possessions; she, for these his extraordinary
qualities, from the degree of a Servant, advanced him to be her owne Husband.
</p>
<p>That unhappy match was no sooner done but she repented it with teares: <span class="marginnote"><i>Mahomet possessed with the falling sicknes.</i></span>for he being subject to the falling sicknesse, would often fall flat on the ground
before her, staring, gaping, and foaming at the mouth; so that his company became
loathsome and detestable. The which begun contempt in his bed-fellow; being to him
manifested, he strove (under the shaddow of invented lies) to mitigate the fury of
her hatefull disdaine; faining, and attesting, that when he fell to the ground, it
was the great God spoke with him, before whose face (sayth he) I am not able to stand;
such is the soliciting of me, with words of terrour and Majesty, to reforme the wayes
of the degenerate people with fire, and sword; sith Moses and Christ (notwithstanding
of their miracles) have beene rejected by the world. The old Trot, believing all these
flattering speeches, was not onely appeased of her former conceit, but also loving
him more then a husband, reverenced him for a divine Prophet; imparting the same unto
her neighbours and gossips. After they had lived two yeares together, the bewitched
Matron dying, left all her possessions to Mahomet; both because she accounted him
to be a Prophet, and next for that loving regard she had of his tender body, being
but 30. yeares of age. He being thus left with great riches, was puft <span class="right-marginnote">[IV. 147.]</span>up in pride, and hauty desires, striving by all inordinary meanes, to bring his new
devised plots to perfection. For the better performance whereof, he consulted with
this Sergius a Nestorian Monk, and Atodala another Thalmudist, a diverted Jew; hereupon
these two helhounds, and the other perverst Runagate, patched up a most monstrous,
and divellish Religion to themselves, and to their miscreant beleevers; partly composed
of the Judaicall law, partly of Arrianisme, partly intermixed with some <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132">132</a>]</span>points of Christianity; and partly of other fantasticall fopperies, which his owne
invention suggested unto him.
</p>
<p>The Booke of this Religion is named the Alcoran, the whole body of which, is but an
exposition, and glosse on the eight commandements he affixed; whereupon dependeth
<span class="marginnote"><i>The Law of Mahomet.</i></span>the whole Mahometanicall Law: First, every one ought to beleeve that God is a great
God, and onely God, and Mahomet is his Prophet. Secondly, every man must marry to
encrease the Sectaries of Mahomet: Thirdly, every one must give of his wealth to the
poore: Fourthly, every one must make his prayers seaven times a day: Fiftly, every
one must keepe a Lent, one moneth in the yeare, this Lent is called Birham, or Ramazan:
Sixtly, Be obedient to thy Parents; which Law is so neglected, that never any children
were, or are more unnaturall then the Turkish be: Seaventhly, thou shalt not kill,
which they inviolable keepe amongst themselves; but the poore Christians feele the
smart thereof. Last and eightly, Doe unto others, as thou wouldst be done unto thy
selfe, the performers of which have large Sophisticall promises ascribed them.
</p>
<p>This new coyned doctrine, was no sooner wrapt up in his execrable Alcoran, but he
began to spit forth his abhominable and blasphemous heresies: Affirming, that Christ
was not the sonne of the most high, nor that <span class="right-marginnote">[IV. 148.]</span>Messias looked for; denying also the Trinity, with many other prophane blasphemies.
The worke concluded, for the better advancement of his purpose, he married the daughter
of the chiefe Prince of his owne tribe: By which new affinity, he not onely seduced
his Father in law, but also the whole linage of that family; by whose acceptance,
and conversion, he also confederated with other associates, and waxed dayly stronger.
Contending continually to divulgate his name, aye more and more, he assembled his
new Alcoranists: exhorting them to assist him in the besieging of Mecha, which Citizens
had in derision rebuked his law, and absolutely disdained his Mahometanicall illusions:
and promised to them, in such a well <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133">133</a>]</span>deserving attempt, both eternall felicity, and the spoiles of these his contradictors;
perswasively assuring them, that God would deliver all the gaine-sayers of his Alcoran
into his hands. By which allurements they being moved, rose to the number of 3000.
in Armes, and menaced Mecha, but the Citizens put him to flight, and so was he thrice
served; till in the end he wonne their City: wherein after his death <span class="marginnote"><i>Mahomets Tombe.</i></span>he was intombed in an Iron Coffin: Which betweene two Adamants hangeth to this day
(as I have been informed of sundry Turkes, who saw it) which confirmed in them a solid
beliefe of his erronious doctrine.
</p>
<p>But now of late the Turkes growing more circumspect then they were, and understanding
the derision of Christianes concerning their hanging Tombe, and because the Turkish
Pilgrimes were often suffocate to death, with a fabulous desart in going to Mecha;
they have transported Mahomets Tombe now to Medina; which is a great deale nearer
to Damascus, and at the entry of Arabia f&#x153;lix; in a glorious Mosquee, where the Tombe
being close ground set, and richly covered with a golden <span class="right-marginnote">[IV. 149.]</span>Cannopy; they have inhibited that any Christian shall come neare to it by two courses,
to wit. twenty foure miles, under the payne of death: which indeed they keepe more
strictly in execution, then Princely Proclamations are obeyed, observed, or regarded
with us; either for regall statutes, or generall benefits of Common-wealth: their
continuance being but like the miracle of nine daies wonder; returne againe from whence
they came frustrat of power, and robbed of obedience. From this time that he vanquished
Mecha, casting out the Greeke Officers, (for then all Arabia was under the Constantinopolitan
Empire) the Saracens began their computation of yeares (as we from Christs Nativity)
which they call Hegira, and begunne about the yeare of our Redemption, 617. Concerning
which time, that Mahomet compiled his divellish Alcoran, beginning his Empire; nigh
about the same time it is observed that Boniface the third begun his Empire, and Antechristian
title, for Phocas having <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134">134</a>]</span>killed the Emperour Mauritius, his Wife and children: To secure himselfe of Italy,
ready to revolt from such a Tyrant, made Boniface universall Bishop and head of the
Church.
</p>
<p>This Boniface was the threescore and fourth Bishop, &amp; <span class="marginnote"><i>The first title of Popes.</i></span>first Pope of Rome: Which was immediatly thereafter confirmed by Puppin the French
King, who also had murdered his Master and Prince; and lastly was ratified by Paleologus,
whose sonne Constantine about 14. yeares thereafter, had his head stroake off, his
wife and daughters put to cruell death, his Empire quite subverted, in the losse of
12. Kingdomes, and 200. Cities, being the just judgements of God upon the sonne, for
the fathers sake, who assigned such an ambitious charge unto that perverse Papality:
After which predominant titles and falsified <span class="right-marginnote">[IV. 150.]</span>power, what long controversies and disputes were betweene the Pope, and the Councels
of Carthage, Calcedon, Ephesus, Allexandria, and Nyce. This Papall prerogative begun
with bloud, and murther, continueth in bloud, and massacres, and (doubtlesse) in the
ende shall perish, and be confounded with bloud, and abhominable destruction.
</p>
<p>And what great debate was of old by the Romane Emperours, in abolishing out of their
Churches, the Images and Idols of Stone, Iron, &amp; Timber, &amp;c. that for many hundreth
yeares they were not suffered to be seene: And at the beginning of the Papality, and
a long time after, the Emperours prohibite them, and diverse Popes have confirmed,
and approved the same: Yet succeeding Popes, and the Empire being divided in East
and West, introducted againe, the dregs of their olde Hethnish and <span class="marginnote"><i>Romish Idolatry.</i></span>Romane Idolatry: and yet they will not be content with the bare name of Images, but
they impose a surname or epithite of sanctity, tearming them holy Images. Truely I
may say, if it were not for these Images, and superstitious Idolatries, they assigne
to them, the Turkes had long agoe bene converted to the Christian Faith.
</p>
<p>I have seene sometimes two thousand Turkes travelling <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135">135</a>]</span><span class="marginnote"><i>Turkish Pilgrimes.</i></span>to Mecha, in Pilgrimage; which is in Arabia felix: where many in a superstitious devotion,
having seene the Tombe of Mahomet, are never desirous to see the vanities of the World
againe: For in a franticke piety they cause a Smith to pull forth their eyes: And
these men are called afterward Hoggeis, that is, Holy men, whom the Turkes much honour,
and regard: and are alwayes led about from towne to towne by mens hands, and fed,
and regarded like unto Princes; or like the Capushines that scourge themselves on
good Friday, met, and homaged at every passing Streete, with prayers, gifts, and adorations.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[IV. 151.]</span>Some write, that Mahomet in his youth was a Souldier, under the conduct of Heraclius,
who imploying certaine Arabians in an expedition to Persia, not onely denied them
their wages, but told them, that, that was not to be given for dogges, which was provided
for the Romane Souldiers. Hence some mutinies arrising in the Army, he, with certaine
Arabians, his Country-men, by faction, separated themselves, and revolted: Whereupon
Mahomet, encouraging them in their defection, was chosen their Captaine; and so for
a certaine time they continued rebellious Runnagates, Theeves, and Robbers of all
people. The subtilty of this dissembler was admirable; who knowing that he was destitute
of heavenly gifts, to worke miracles, feignd, that God sent him with the sword: He
also promised, at the end of a thousand yeares to returne, and bring them to Paradice;
<span class="marginnote"><i>Mahomet hath broke his promise.</i></span>but he hath falsified his promise, for the time is expired forty yeares ago. And they
imagining, that he is either diseased, or become lame in his journey, have ascribed
to him another thousand yeares to come. But long may their wicked and faithlesse generation
gape, before he come, untill such time, that in a generall convocation, they be partakers
of his endlesse damnation in Hell; unlesse it please the Lord in his mercy to convert
them before that time.
</p>
<p>Mahomet, chiefly prohibiteth in his Alcoran, the eating of Swines flesh, and drinking
of Wine, which indeed the best sort do, but the baser kind are dayly drunkards: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136">136</a>]</span>Their common drinke is Sherpet, composed of Water, Honey, and Sugar, which is exceeding
delectable in the taste: And the usuall courtesie, they bestow on their friends, who
visite them, is a Cup of Coffa, made of a kind of seed called Coava, and of a blackish
colour; which they drinke so hote as possible they can, and is good to <span class="right-marginnote">[IV. 152.]</span>expell the crudity of raw meates, and hearbes, so much by them frequented. And those
that cannot attaine to this liquor, must be contented with the cooling streames of
water.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Oppression of Turkes.</i></span>It is incident to Turkes, which have not the generosity of mind to temper felicity,
to be glutted with the superfluous fruites of doubtfull prosperity. Neither have they
a patient resolution to withstand adversity, nor hope to expect the better alteration
of time. But by an infused malice in their wicked spirits, when they are any way calamited,
will with importunate compulsion, cause the poore slavish subjected Christians, surrender
all they have, the halfe, or so forth, sometimes with strokes, menacings, and sometimes
death it selfe; which plainely doth demonstrate their excessive cruelty, and the poore
Christians inevitable misery. And yet being complained upon, they are severely punished,
or else put to death, for committing of such unallowable Ryots, being expresly against
the Imperiall Law of the Turke, concerning the quietnesse and liberty of the Christians.
</p>
<p>I have often heard Turkes brawle one with another most vilely, but I never saw, or
heard, that they either in private or publicke quarrels, durst strike one another,
neither dare they for feare of severe punishment, imposed to such quarrellors: But
they will injure and strike Christians, who dare not say it is amisse, or strike againe.
It is a common thing with them, to kill their servants for a very small offence, and
when they have done, throw them like dogges in a ditch. And oftentimes (if not so)
will lay them downe on their backes, hoysing up their heeles, bind their feete together,
and fasten them to a post, and with a cudgell give them three or foure hundreth <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137">137</a>]</span>blowes on the soles of their feete: Whereupon peradventure, some ever go lame after.
Their servants are <span class="right-marginnote">[IV. 153.]</span>bought and sold, like bruite beasts in Markets; neither can these miserable drudges
ever recover liberty, except they buy themselves free, either by one meane or other.
Their wives are not farre from the like servitude, for the men by the Alcoran, are
admitted to marry as many women as they will, or their ability can keepe. And if it
shall happen, that any one of these women (I meane either wife or Concubine) prostituteth
her selfe to an other man besides her husband; then may he, by authority, bind her
hands and feete, hang a stone about her necke, and cast her into a River, which by
them is usually done in the night.
</p>
<p>But when these Infidels please to abuse poore Christian women against their husbands
will, they little regard the transgression of the Christian Law; who as well defloure
their daughters, as their wives; yet the devout Mahometans never meddle with them,
accompting themselves damned to copulate (as they thinke) with the offspring of dogges.
The Turkes generally, when they commit any copulation with Christians, or their owne
sexe, they wash themselves in a South running fountaine, before the Sun rising, thinking
thereby to wash away their sinnes.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The Turkes Justice.</i></span>If a Turke should happen to kill another Turke, his punishment is thus; after he is
adjudged to death, he is brought forth to the market place, and a blocke being brought
hither of foure foote high; the malefactor is stripd naked; and then layd thereupon
with his belly downeward, they drawe in his middle together so small with running
cords, that they strike his body a two with one blow: his hinder parts they cast to
be eaten by hungry dogges kept for the same purpose; and the forequarters and head
they throw into a grievous fire, made there for the same end: and this is the punishment
for man-slaughter.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[IV. 154.]</span>But for murder or treason he is more cruelly used, for being convicted &amp; condemned,
he is brought forth before the people, where in the street there is an exceeding high
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138">138</a>]</span>Stripad erected, much like to a May-pole: which tree from the roote, till it almost
come to the top, is all set about full of long sharpe iron pikes, and their poynts
upward: The Villaine being strip&#x2019;d naked, and his hands bound backward, they bind
a strong rope about his shoulders and cleavings: And then hoysing him up to the pillow
or top of the tree, they let the rope flee loose, whence downe he falles, with a rattle,
among the iron pykes, hanging either by the buttocks, by the breasts, by the sides,
or shoulders; and there sticking fast in the ayre, he hangeth till his very bones
rot and fall downe, and his body be devoured being quicke, with ravenous Eagles, kept
to prey upon his carkas for the same purpose.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Turkish marriages.</i></span>But now I come to their nuptiall rites, their custome and manner of marriage is thus:
If a man affecteth a yong mayd, he buyeth her of her parents, and giveth a good summe
of money for her, and after she is bought, he enrolles her name in the Cadies Booke,
witnessing she is his bound wife, bought of her father. Loe, this is all the forme
of their marriage: This being done, the father of the woman sendeth houshold-stuffe
home with the Bride; which is carried through the streets on Mulets or Camells backes,
the two new married folkes marching before, are conveyed with musicke, their owne
acquaintance, and friends unto his house.
</p>
<p>The Turkes in generall, whensoever they loath or dislike their wives, use to sell
them in markets, or otherwise bestow them on their men-slaves: And although their
affection were never so great towards them, yet they never eate together, for commonly
the women stand, and <span class="right-marginnote">[IV. 155.]</span>serve their husbands at meate, and after that, they eate a part by themselves, secretly;
without admission of any mankind in their company, if they be above foureteene yeares
of age. They goe seldome abroad, unlesse it be each Thursday at night, when they goe
to the Graves to mourne for the dead, alwayes covering their faces, very modestly
with white or blacke masks, which are never <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139">139</a>]</span>uncovered, till they returne to their houses. Many other ceremonies they have, which
would be too prolixe for me to recite. And notwithstanding of all this externall gravity,
amongst these hirelings, yet there are in Constantinople above 40000. brothel-houses,
Turqueski as Libertines; in any of which, if a Christian (especially Francks) be apprehended,
he must either turne Turke, or Slave all his life: But the women by policy apply a
counter-poyson to this severity, for they accustomably come to the Chambers of their
Benefactors and well-willers, or other places appointed secretly, whereso they learne
either a French Syncopa, or an Italian Bergamasko.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The Emperors Concubines.</i></span>As for the great Turkes Concubines, they are of number eight hundred, being the most
part Emeeres, Bashawes, and Timariots daughters: The third and inmost part of the
Seraglia is allotted for their residence, being well attended at all times with numbers
of Enuches, and other gelded officers: Every morning they are ranked in a great Hall,
and set on high and open seats: where when he commeth, and selecting the youngest
and fairest, he toucheth her with a rod; and immediately she followeth him into his
cabine of leachery, where if any action be done, shee receiveth from the Head-Clarke
her approbation thereupon, which ever afterwards serveth her for a conditionall dowry
to her marriage, with much honour and <span class="right-marginnote">[IV. 156.]</span>reputation besides: And if any of them conceave, and the child borne, it is suddenly
dispatched from this life: <span class="marginnote"><i>A hundred Concubines changed every moneth.</i></span>The oldest hundreth, every first Friday of the moneth are turned out, and another
new hundred come in to make good the number: Their entrie and issue is alwayes at
one of the posterne gates of the Parke, toward the sea side, and joyning nigh to their
Pallace: Whence crossing Bosphore, in an appointed barge, they both goe and come in
one day, from and to the Galata, which I my selfe did see three several times: The
oldest and last hundred that are every moneth dismissed, they depart from the Galata,
home to their Parents and severall Countreys, rejoycing that they were counted worthy
to be chosen and entertained <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140">140</a>]</span>to be their Emperours Concubines. The custome of the great Turke is, every Friday
being their Sabboth day after divine service and dinner, to run at the Glove in a
open place before all the people, with some Hagars, or yong striplings that accompany
him; who have the Glove hanging as high on a sticke, as we have the ring with us:
And truely of all the Turkish Emperours that ever were, this Achmet was the most gentle
&amp; favourable to Christians; who rather for his bounty and tendernesse might have beene
intitulated the Christian Emperour, then the Pagane King: for he dissanulled all the
exactions that had beene inflicted by his predecessors upon his tributarie Christian
subjects; and cancelled the custome or tythe of their Male children, abrogating also
that imposition on their Female dowries.
</p>
<p>The Lent of the Turkes is called Byrham, which continueth the space of a moneth once
in the yeare: In all which time, from the Sunne rising to his setting, they neither
eate nor drinke: And at their prayers (especially in this fasting) they use often
to reiterate these words <span class="right-marginnote">[IV. 157.]</span>Hue, hue, hue, that is; He, he, he, alone is God; or, There is but one onely supreme
Power; which they doe in derision of Christians, who (as they say) adore three Gods.
They have also this sinister opinion, that at the day of Judgement, when Mahomet shall
appeare, there shall be three displayed Banners, under the which all good <span class="marginnote"><i>The Turkes Paradise.</i></span>people shall be conducted to Paradise: The one of Moses, under the which the children
of Israel shall be: The second of Jesus, under which Christians shall be: The third
of Mahomet, under the which shall be the Arabs, Turkes, and Musilmans: All which,
they thinke, shall be elevated to severall honours; and they in promotion shall be
discerned from the rest, by Chambers made of resplendant light, which God will give
them; wherein they shall have banquetings, feastings, dancing, and the best melody
can be devised; and that they shall spend their times with amorous Virgins, (whose
mansion shall be neare by) the men never exceeding the age of thirty yeares, and the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141">141</a>]</span>Virgines fifteene, and both shall have their Virginities renewed, as fast, as lost.
</p>
<p>They hold also this, as a confident article of their Beliefe, there are seven Paradises
in heaven, the pavements whereof are laid with gold, silver, pearles, pretious stones,
and garnished with stately buildings, and pleasant gardens, wherein are all sorts
of fruit, and Princely Pallaces; through the which runne Rivers of milke, honey, and
wine.
</p>
<p>The first Paradise, they call it Genete Alcholde, the second Alfirduzy, the third
Anthinak, the fourth Reduasch, the fift Azelem, the sixt Alcodush, that is holy, and
the seventh Almega, that is, the greatest. And that in the midst of this last Paradise,
there is a stately tree, called Tubah, the leafe of which is partly of gold, <span class="right-marginnote">[IV. 158.]</span>and partly of silver: whose boughes extend round about the wals of this seventh Paradice,
whereon the name of Mahomet is written, neare to the name of God, in these words,
Alla, illa, he, allah, Mahomet Rezul allah. The which words are in such reverence
amongst the Turkes, that if a Christian should happen, unadvisedly to repeate them,
he is adjudged to a most cruell death, or compulsed to renounce his Christian Religion.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The Turkes Lent.</i></span>Their Lent lasteth thirty dayes, called Byrham, some name it also Ramadan; induring
which time, they eate nor drinke nothing from Sunne rising to its setting downe: but
when night commeth they Cormandize at their selfe pleasures: Their moneth of Lent
is our January, where every day after their severall devotions, they goe to solemne
playes; and all kind of prophane pastimes: counting that best devotion, which is most
sutable to their dispositions; allotting fancy to follow their folly, and blindnesse,
to overtop the ignorance of nature, drawing all their drifts within the circle of
destruction: But indeed, as they are blind, in the true way of sacred worship; yet
are they masked with a wonderfull zeale to their devoted blindnesse; surpassing farre
in shew, and observations, the generall Professours of Christianity, and all the Ceremonies
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142">142</a>]</span>can bee annexed thereunto: Theirs running on with the flouds of ignorant affection,
and ours distracted with the inutile novelties of superfluous Schoole questions: which
indeed do more distemper the truth, than render God to be rightly glorified.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The Turkes opinion of hell.</i></span>As concerning their opinion of Hell, they hold it to be a deepe Gulfe, betwixt two
Mountaines: from the mouth whereof are Dragons, that continually throw fire, being
large eight leagues, and hath a darke entry, where the horrible Fiends meete the perplexed
sinners, conveying <span class="right-marginnote">[IV. 159.]</span>them till they come to a bridge, that is so narrow as the edge of a Razor: whereupon
these who have not committed haynous offences, may passe over to Hell, but those who
have done Buggery (as the most part of them do) and homicide, shall fall headlong
from it, to the profoundest pit in Hell, where they shall sometimes burne in fire,
&amp; sometimes be cast into hot boyling waters to be refreshed. And for the greater punishment
of the wicked (say they) God hath planted a tree in Hell named Sajaratash, or Roozo
Saytanah, that is, the head of the Divell, upon the fruit of which, the damned continually
feed: Mahomet in one of the Chapters of his Alcoran calleth this tree, the Tree of
Malediction.
</p>
<p>They also thinke the tormented soules may one day be saved, providing they do indure
the scorching flames of Hell patiently. Thus, as briefly as I could, have I layd open
the opinions of the Turkes, concerning their Heaven and Hell, before the eyes of these,
who peradventure have never bene acquainted with such a ghostly Discourse.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The number of all the Emperours in East and West.</i></span>And now I thinke it not amisse to reckon you up in generall all the Romane and Greeke
Emperours, that have bene from the beginning to this present time, both in the East,
and in the West, with the number of the Turkish Emperours also: Beginning now at Julius
Cæsar, the first Dictatour of Romane Emperour, to Constantine the Great, who transported
the seate of the Empire from Rome to Constantinople, he was the three score and fourth
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143">143</a>]</span>Emperour: And from Constantine the Great in the East, to the first made Emperour in
the West, there were thirty nine Emperours: of whom Constantine the sixth, sonne to
Leo the third, with Irena his wife was the last sole Emperour, and she Empresse of
East and West: After whose death and overthrow, Charlemaine was called in to <span class="right-marginnote">[IV. 160.]</span>Italy to danton the Lombards, who had oppressed that region, and the peace of the
Church for two hundreth yeares: He chased them from Rome, Apulia, and from all Italy,
and was therefore declared by Pope Leo, the Romane Emperour of the West: from Charlemaine
to this present Ferdinando that now raigneth, Charlemaine being the hundreth and fourth,
there were forty and one Emperors: So in all, with this Emperour Ferdinando, lately
Duke of Grasse, the number amounts to of these Emperours, counting from Julius Cæsar
to Constantine the sixt, the last sole Emperour of the East, and after him, from Charlemaine
the first Emperour of the West, to this time, their number have bene a hundreth and
forty sixe Emperours.
</p>
<p>Some whereof were Greekes, which cannot perfectly be set downe, in regard some were
Empresses, and others suddenly elected, were as suddenly murthered or poysoned.
</p>
<p>Now to reckon the Turkish Emperors, I will first begin from the time that the Turkes
tooke a Monarchick name, under the name of Ottoman, even to Mahomet the second, the
first Grecian Emperour, beginning, I say at Ottoman, the sonne of Orthogule the first
Emperour of the Turkes, and the first that erected the glory of his Nation; there
were nine Emperours to Mahomet the second: And from him to this present Amurath, that
now raigneth, there have bene eleven Emperours: The number of which are onely twenty,
and or they come to thirty, they and theirs, I hope, shall be rooted from the earth.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The beginning of the Turkes.</i></span>The Originall of the Turkes, is sayd to have bene in Scythia, from whence they came
to Arabia Petrea, and giving battell oft to the Sarazens, in the ende subdued <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144">144</a>]</span>them, and so they multiplied, and mightily increased: the apparence of their further
increasing, is very evident, <span class="right-marginnote">[IV. 161.]</span>except God of his mercy towards us prevent their blood sucking threatnings, with the
vengeance of his just judgements.
</p>
<p>The Sarazens are descended of Esau, who after he had lost the blessing, went and inhabited
in Arabia Petrea; and his Posterity, striving to make a cleere distinction betweene
them, the Ismaelites, and Jewes, called themselves (as come of Sara) Sarazens; and
not of Hagar, the handmaide of Abraham, of whom came the Ismaelites, neither of the
race of Jacob, of whom came the Jewes. But now the Sarazens being joyned with the
Turkes, their Conquerours, have both lost their name, and the right of their discent.
</p>
<p>The Turkes which are borne and bred in the lesser Asia, and East parts of Europe,
<span class="marginnote"><i>The Turkes complexion.</i></span>are generally well complexioned, proportionably compacted, no idle nor superfluous
talkers, servile to their grand Signior, excessively inclined to Venery, and zealous
in Religion: Their heads are alwayes shaven, reserving onely one tuft in the top above,
by which they thinke one day to be caught to Heaven by Mahomet, and covered on all
sides, counting it an opprobious thing to see any uncover his head, they weare their
Beards long, as a signe of gravity, for they esteeme them to be wise men, who have
long beards: The women are of a low stature, thicke and round of growth, going seldome
abroad (unlesse it be each Thursday at night, when they go to mourne upon the graves
of their dead friends) and then they are modestly masked: they are fearefull and shame-fast
abroad, but lascivious within doores, and pleasing in matters of incontinency; and
they are accounted most beautifull, who have the blackest browes, the widest mouthes,
and the greatest eyes.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[IV. 162.]</span>The other Turkes which are borne in Asia major, and Ægypt, (I speake not of the Moores
of Barbary) are of a greater stature, tanny, cruell, a barbarous and uncivill <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145">145</a>]</span>people. The better sort use the Slavonian tongue, the vulgar speake the Turkish language,
which being originally the Tartarian speech, they borrow from the Persian their words
of state, from the Arabicke, their words of Religion, from the Grecians, their termes
of warre, and from the Italian their words and titles of navigation.
</p>
<p>The puissance of the great Turke is admirable, yet the most part of his Kingdomes
in Asia, are not well inhabited, neither populous, but these parts which border with
Christians, are strongly fortified with Castles, people, and munition: If Christian
Princes could concord, and consult together, it were an easie thing in one yeare,
to subdue the Turkes, and roote out their very names from the earth; yea, moreover
I am certified, that there are moe Christians, even slaves and subjects to the great
Turke, which do inhabite his dominions, then might overthrow and conquer these Infidells,
if they had worthy Captaines, Governours and furniture of Armes, without the helpe
of any Christian of Christendome.
</p>
<p>And yet againe, I thinke it not amisse to discourse more particularly of the Turkish
manners, of their riches, and of their forces of warres, and the manner of their conducements.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The Turkes are Tartarians.</i></span>The Turkes being naturally discended of the Scythians or Tartars, are of the second
stature of man, and robust of nature, circumspect and couragious in all their attempts,
and no way given to industry or labour, but are wonderfull avaritious and covetuous
of money above all the nations of the world. They never observe their promises, unlesse
it be with advantage, and are naturally prone to deceive <span class="right-marginnote">[IV. 163.]</span>strangers; changing their conditionall bargaines, as time giveth occasion to their
liking: They are humble one to another, but especially to their superiours, before
whom they doe not onely great homage, but also keepe great silence, and are wonderfull
coy during the time of their presence: They are extreamely inclined to all sorts of
<span class="marginnote"><i>Libidinous Turkes.</i></span>lascivious luxury; and generally adicted, besides all their sensuall and incestuous
lusts, unto Sodomy, which they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146">146</a>]</span>account as a daynty to digest all their other libidinous pleasures. They hold that
every one hath the houre of his death wrot on his fore-brow, and that none can escape,
the good or evill houre predestinated for them: This rediculous errour makes them
so bold and desperate, yea, and often, to runne headlong in the most inevitable dangers:
They are not much given to domesticke pastimes, as Chesse, Cards, Dice, and Tables,
but abroad and in travell, they are exceeding kind disposers of their meate and drinke
to any stranger without exception: The better sort of their women, are sumptuously
attyred, and adorned with pearles and precious stones, and some of them are accustomed
to turne their hands and haire into a red colour, but especially the nayles of their
hands and feete; and are wont to go to bathe themselves in Stoves twice a weeke, as
well as men.
</p>
<p>The true Turkes weare on their heads white Turbanes, save a few that are esteem&#x2019;d
to be of Mahomets kinred, and they weare greene Shashes, being most part of them Priests:
the better part of the Turkes in Asia, care not for fish, but these Turkes which remaine
in Europe love fish better then flesh, especially at Constantinople or Stambolda,
where the best fishes and most abundance of them are taken, that be in the world,
and that in the blacke Sea: They are ever desirous to seeke advantage <span class="right-marginnote">[IV. 164.]</span>on their neighbours, which if they cannot by force, they will under colour of truce,
accomplish it with perfidiousnesse. And if their interprises, finde no happy event,
they are never a whit ashamed to take the flight, yet are they generally good souldiers,
and well taught in martiall discipline: Their Armies in marching, or camping (notwithstanding
infinite multitudes) keepe modestie and silence, and are extreamely obedient unto
their Captaines and Commanders: When the great Signior is abroad with his armie at
warres, the Turkes at home within Townes, use great prayers, and fasting for him and
them: They ingeniously describe the victories of their Ancestours, and joyfully sing
them in rimes and songs; thinking thereby <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147">147</a>]</span>that fashion in recalling the valiant deeds of their predecessours, to be the onely
meane to encourage their souldiers to be hardy, resolute and desperate in all their
interprises: <span class="marginnote"><i>Turkes are noe Schollers.</i></span>They are not given to contemplation, nor studdy of Letters or Arts; yet they have
divers faire Schooles, where the publicke lecture of their legall Lawes are professed,
and Mahometanisme; to the intent that Children, being elected to be brought up there
for a nones, may be instructed, to be profitable expounders of their Alcoran, and
judicious Judges for the government of the Common-wealth: It is seldome, and rarely
seene, that a Turke will speake with a woman in the streets; nay, not so much as in
their Mosquees one to be in sight of another; and yet they are Lords and Masters of
their Wives and Concubines, from whom they receive as great respect, service and honour,
as from their bond and bought slaves.
</p>
<p>Now as concerning his riches, the chiefest three parts of Commerce of all kind of
merchandise, and abounding in silver and gold in all the Turkes dominions, as well
<span class="right-marginnote">[IV. 165.]</span>in Asia, and Affricke, as Europe, are these, Constantinople in Thracia of Europe:
Aleppo in Syria of Asia major; and grand Cayro in Ægypt of Affricke: for these are
the three Maggezzines of the whole Empire, that draw the whole riches, money, and
trafficke to them of all the Imperiall Provinces: It is thought that ordinarily and
<span class="marginnote"><i>The great Turkes yearely rent.</i></span>annually the rent of the great Turke amounteth to sixteene millions of gold, notwithstanding
that some doe make it lesser: But because it is so hard to judge of any Monarchs rents;
being like the infinite concavities of the earth, sending, and receiving so innumerable
wayes their streames of riches, I&#x2019;le desist from any other instances: And yet the
great Turkes revenewes, are no way answerable to his great &amp; large dominions: The
causes arising hereupon are many, of whom I will select three or foure of the chiefest
reasons: First the Turkes being more given to armes, to conquer, to destroy and ruine,
and to consume the wealth of the people they overcome, leaving them destitute, of
nuriture; rather then any way to give course <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148">148</a>]</span>for their encreasing and stablishing of traffique, out of which should flow the royall
advantages. <span class="marginnote"><i>Certaine reasons.</i></span>And the reason why they keepe their subjects poore, and frustrate themselves of great
profits; is onely to weaken, and enfeeble them, whereby they should not have wherewith
to move insurrection or rebellion against them. And on the other part, the Greekes
are as unwilling to be industrious in Arts, traficke or cultivage; seeing what they
possesse is not their owne, but is taken from them at all occasions, with tyranny
&amp; oppression. For what gaines the sower, if another reape the profit; So in the Ottomans
estate, there be great Forrests, and desartuous Countries; proceeding of the scarcity
of people to inhabit there, the multitudes being drawne from Asia, to strengthen the
frontiers of his dominions in Europe.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[IV. 166.]</span>And besides there is another reason of the dispopulosity of these parts; to wit, when
the great Turkes Army, is to march to a farre Countrey to make warres, then must their
vulgar subdued peasants, perhaps twenty or thirty thousands go along with them, to
carry their victuals, and all manner of provision, being taken from the plough, and
constrained to this servitude, and notwithstanding the halfe of them never returne
againe: Partly, because of the change of food, and aire, and partly because of their
long travell and insupportable service, both in heate and cold: And to these of the
first reason, there is another perpendicular cause; to wit, that the whole commerce
of all commodities in Turkey, is in the hands of Jewes, and Christians, to wit, Ragusans,
Venetians, English, French, and Flemings, who so warily menage their businesse, that
they enjoy the most profits of any trading there, dissappointing the Turkes owne subjects
of their due, and ordinary trafficke.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Parsells of ground for Tymariots.</i></span>The last and most principall reason is, which is a great deale of more importance
than his Revenues; to wit, the great number of his Timars: for the Turkish Emperours;
being immediate Maisters of the lands they overcome, they divide the same in Timars
or commandements: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149">149</a>]</span>leaving little or nothing at all to the auncient Inhabitants; they dispose upon these
proportions, to valerous Souldiers, that have done good service: And with this condition,
that they mainetaine, and have alwayes in readinesse Horses for the warres: which
is an excellent good order for the preservation of his Empire; for if these Timariots
were not rewarded, with such absolute possessions of parcell grounds, the state of
his power would suddenly runne to ruine: for the profit of which lands, maintaining
themselves, their horses, and their families, maketh them <span class="right-marginnote">[IV. 167.]</span>the more willing to concurre in the infallible service of their Emperour: These Timars
or grounds, entertaine through all his Dominions, about two hundreth and fifty thousand
horses, that are ever in readinesse to march at the first advertisement, without any
charges to the great Signior, being bound to maintaine themselves in during the warres:
And yet these Timariots, and their horses, cannot yearely be maintained under the
value of ten Millions of Gold: The consideration whereof, makes me astonished, when
I recall, the relations of some ragged Authors, who dare compare the Great Turkes
Revenues unto our petty Princes of Christendome.
</p>
<p>This establishment of Timars, and the by-past election of Azamglians, or young children
to be made Jannisaries have bene the two strong Foundations, that supported so inviolably
the Turkish Empire. The Romane Emperours for a long time used the selfe same manner
for the assuring of their persons, and estate, in election of yong males to be their
guard. They were called the Pretorian Army, and this taxation of children was the
first thing that moved the Flemings, to revolt against the Romanes.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Policies of Turkes.</i></span>As for the Turkish Cavalrie, they sustaine two important effects, first they keepe
under awe and subjection, the great Turks subjects, who otherwise perhaps wold revolt:
And next they are ordained for any dependant interprise for field Garrisons, yea,
and the principall sinewes of the warres: and yet the election of the grand Signior,
lieth most in the hands of the Janizaries, who <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150">150</a>]</span>can not perfectly say he is Emperour before they confirme him in his Throne.
</p>
<p>The Turkes have three things in their Armies which are very fearefull, to wit, the
infinite number of men, great discipline, and force of Munition: As for discipline,
<span class="right-marginnote">[IV. 168.]</span>they are not onely governed with great silence, and obedience, but they are ruled
also with signes of the eye, and being tractable, they are tied to maine conducements:
And although their multitudes have often bred confusion to them, so that little Armies
have broke and overcome them; yet in their flight they are so cautulous, that a small
number can do them no absolute violence nor finall overthrow: for as they assaile,
so they flye without feare.
</p>
<p>The first Residence of the Turkish Emperour after his comming from Ægypt, was at Priusa
in Bithinia: thence it was transported to Andreanople, and then to Constantinople,
where it abideth to this day: Besides, all his great <span class="marginnote"><i>Beglerbegs or Bashaes.</i></span>Bassaws in Europe, which are eight, one in Buda in Hungary, another in Moldavia, the
third in Dacia, the fourth at Bagaviliezza in Bosna, &amp;c. He hath also in Affrick a
Bassaw, in Algeir, another in Tunneis, the third in Tripolis, and the fourth in Ægypt,
&amp;c. And in Asia major and minor, to wit, one in Aleppo, of Syria, one in Damascus,
another at Balsera, the fourth at Meccha in Arabia fælix, the fift in Carmania, the
sixt in Cyprus, the seventh in the Rhodes, the eighth at Arzeron in Armenia major,
the ninth and tenth at Testis and Upan, on the Frontiers of Gurgestan and Persia,
&amp;c. For Arsenals he hath foure for sea, to wit, one at Perah or Galata, containing
a hundred thirty and three Galleys: The second at Gallipoli of twenty Galleys: The
third Arsenall is at Savezza upon the Red Sea, consisting of twenty five Galleys:
And the fourth is at Belsara in Arabia fælix, towards the Persian Gulfe, depending
of fifteene Galleys, which are kept there to afflict the Portugals, remaining in the
Ile of Ormus; and other parts adjacent there.
</p>
<p>The Turkes have a custome, when they are maisters <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151">151</a>]</span>of any Province, to extermine all the native Nobility, <span class="right-marginnote">[IV. 169.]</span>chiefely these of the blood-royall of the Countrey: And neverthelesse they permit
to all and every one of theirs to live and follow his owne Religion as he pleaseth
without violence or constraint.
</p>
<p>Amongst the Turkes there is noe Gentility, nor Nobility, but are all as ignoble and
inferiour members, to one maine body the great Turke, lineally descending of the house
of Ottoman: whose magnificence, puissance, and power is such, that the most eloquent
tongue cannot sufficiently declare: His thousands or Janisaries, Shouses, and others
dayly attending him: which are the nerves and sinewes of the Warlike body of his whole
Monarchy and imperiall estate: His hundreds (besides his Queene) of Concubines, hourely
maintained by his meanes, and monethly renewed: His Armies, Bashawes, Emeeres, Vizier-bashawes,
Sanzacks, Garrisons, and Forces here and there dispersed amongst his dominions, would
be impossible for me briefly to relate. The inhumane policy of the Turkes, to avoid
civill dissention is such, that the seede of Ottoman (all except one of them) are
strangled to death: Wherefore, as Augustus Cæsar said of Herod in the like case, it
is better to be the great Turkes dogge, then his Sonne. His Daughters or Sisters are
not so used, but are given in marriage to any Bassa, whom so they affect; yet with
this condition; the King saith to his Daughter, or Sister, I give thee this man to
be thy slave; and if he offend thee in any case, or be disobedient to thy will, here
I give thee a Dagger to cut off his head; which alwaies they weare by their sides
for the same purpose.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Noble Persians.</i></span>The Persians differ much from the Turkes, in nobility, humanity, and activity, and
especially in points of Religion: who by contention thinke each other accursed; <span class="right-marginnote">[IV. 170.]</span>and notwithstanding both factions are under the Mahometanicall Lawe. Neither are the
Sonnes of the Persian Kings, so barbarously handled, as theirs; for all the brethren
(one excepted) are onely made blind, wanting <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152">152</a>]</span>their eyes, and are alwayes afterward gallantly maintained, like Princes. And it hath
oftentimes fallen out, that some of these Kings, dying without procreate Heires; there
have of these blind sonnes succeeded to the Empire, who have restored againe the seed
of that Royall family.
</p>
<p>And now the great advantage, that the Turkes have dayly upon the Persians, is onely
because of their Infantery, which the Persians no wayes are accustomed with, fighting
alwayes on Horse-backe; neither are the Persians adicted or given to build Forts,
or Fortifications, neither have they any great use of Munition, but exposing themselves
ever to the field in the extreame hazard of battell, become ever doubtfull in their
victories: whose <span class="marginnote"><i>Babylon regained by the Persians.</i></span>courage and valour cannot be paraleld among all the people of the Easterne world,
as Babylon in their late and last fortunes may give sufficient testimony thereof.

to imbrace the violence of a firy fac&#x2019;d season: where having dutifully taken my Counge
of many worthy friends, who both kindly, and respectively had used me; especially,
the aforesayd English Ambassadour, Sir Thomas Glover: And the new Ambassadour, Sir
Paul Pinder, who had lately arrived there <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154">154</a>]</span>before my departure, and had bene formerly Consull in Aleppo five yeares.
</p>
<p>I left Constantinople, and imbarked in a Ship belonging to London, named the Allathya,
whereof one Maister Wylds in Ratcliffe was Maister; where indeed both he and his Company
kindly and respectively used me, for the space of twelve daies; being bound for Smyrna,
and so we sayled along the coast of Bithinia in Asia minor.
</p>
<p>Bithinia hath on the North Hellespont: On the West Phrigia; on the East Pontus: and
on the South Capadocia or Leuco Syria: The chiefe Citties are Calcedon, where, by
comaund of the Emperour Martianus, the fourth Generall Counsell was assembled, to
repell the Heresie of Nestorius. Nigh unto the side of Hellespont is Mount <span class="right-marginnote">[V. 172.]</span>Stella, famous for that victory which Pompey had over Mithridates: And where Tamberlane
with 800000. Tartarians incountred Bajazet, whose Army consisted of 500000. men; of
which 200000. lost their lives that day: And <span class="marginnote"><i>Bajazet taken by Tamberlane.</i></span>Bajazet being taken, was carried about in an Iron Cage on whose necke Tamberlane used
to set his foote, when he mounted on horse-backe; and at last beate out his owne braines
against the barres of the Iron Cage: the next Cities are Nicomedia; and Nyce, where
the first Generall Councell was kept, Anno 314. to which there assembled 318. Bishops
to beate downe the Arian Heresie. The other Townes are Prusa and Labissa; the former
was built by Prusias King of Bithinia, who betrayed Hanniball when he fled to him
for succour; in the latter Hanniball lyeth buried. Prusa was a long time the seate
of the Ottoman Kings, till Mahomet the first began to keepe his Residence at Andrianople:
The chiefe Rivers are Ascanius, Sangaro, and Granico, nigh unto which Alexander obtained
the first victory against the Persians.
</p>
<p>Having passed Bithinia, and the Phrigian coast, we fetched up Cenchrea, where Saint
Paul cut his haire, after his vow was performed, Acts 18. 18. Being a Towne now inhabited
by Greekes, with a Turkish Governour, and of small importance, in regard of other
neighbouring <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155">155</a>]</span>places, that bereave them of their trafficke; and because the Jewes do not much frequent
here: the Inhabitants are rather turned spectators to Vertue, than any way inherent
to necessary goodnesse: Want of Strangers being one let, and vitious otiosity the
other stop: This City standeth by the sea side in the North part of Ionia, but more
truely on the West frontiers of Lydia. Lydia hath on the West Phrigia minor: on the
South Ionia: on the East Paphlagonia, on the North-west Æolus, &amp; a part of <span class="right-marginnote">[V. 173.]</span>Phrygia major. The chiefe Metropole is Sardis, once the Royall seat of Cr&#x153;sus the
richest King in his time, who in his full prosperity, was told by Solon, that no man
could reckon upon felicity so long as he lived, because there might be great mutability
of Fortune, which afterward he found true: The recitall of which advertisement, when
he was taken prisoner by Cyrus saved his life: The next City is Pergamus, where Parchment
was first invented, and therefore called Pergamenum: here was Galen borne, who lived
so healthfully one hundreth and forty yeares: the reason whereof, he thus affixeth;
he never eate or drunke his full, &amp; ever carried some sweete perfumes with him. The
other Townes are Thyatira, Laodicea, and Philadelphia.
</p>
<p>Upon the twelfth day after our departure from Constantinople, we arrived at Smirna,
being foure hundreth miles distant.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The City of Smyrna.</i></span>This City was one of the seven Churches mentioned Revelation 2. 8. And standeth in
Ionia: of this place was the famous Martyr Polycarpus Bishop, who sometimes had bene
Schollar to John the Evangelist: and living till he was of great age, was at last
put to death for Christs sake. It is a goodly place, having a faire Haven for Ships:
They have great trafficke with all Nations; especially for fine Silke, Cotten wooll,
and Dimmety, brought to it by the Countrey Peasants, which straungers buy from them.
</p>
<p>Truely, neare unto this City, I saw a long continuing plaine, abounding in Cornes,
Wines, all sorts of fruitfull <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156">156</a>]</span>herbage, and so infinitely peopled, that methought Nature seemed, with the peoples
industry to contend, the one by propagating creatures, the other by admirable agriculture.
</p>
<p>That for Commodities and pleasure, it is little inferiour unto the valley of Suda
in Candy, which maketh the <span class="right-marginnote">[V. 174.]</span>inhabitants wondrous insolent: for as mirth is made of <span class="marginnote"><i>Wealth is the brother of vice.</i></span>pleasure, and with pleasures all vices are baited; even so there is not a more incorrigible
creature then man in prosperity, nor so modest nor reformed an one, as he, to whom
fortune hath lent but a sparing and crooked favour, which indeed I hold best of all:
for it is the forming of the mind, not the tongue, nor hand, that can preferre us
to true felicitie: And would to God that these, upon whome none but faire windes have
ever blowne, in the carreire of their supposed happinesse, could but see for all their
high and overtopping places, their end, and resting place: since they are nought but
the arrowes of the omnipotent arme, that are yet flying not at theirs but his marke;
and no more owners of their owne proposed ends, then they are guilty of their owne
beginnings: surely they would cover their faces with another kind of maske then they
do: and make their actions seeme more cleare, then the force of policie can obumbrate
their wicked devices.
</p>
<p>Thiatyra now called Tiria, one also of the seven Churches is not from Smirna above
eighteene miles.
</p>
<p>From this Citie (having left my kind English men and their stately ship that carryed
24. pieces of Ordonance,) I imbarked in a Turkish Carmoesalo, that carried nothing
but her loading, being bound for Rhodes. In our sayling along the coast of Ionia,
the first place of any note I saw, was <span class="marginnote"><i>Ephesus decayed.</i></span>the ruinous Citie of Ephesus; yet somewhat inhabited with Greekes, Jewes, and a few
Turkes; but no waies answerable to its former glory and magnificence, being rather
a monument for memory, then a continuing Towne of any excellency: neverthelesse it
is pleasantly adorned with Gardens, faire fields, and greene woods of Olive <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157">157</a>]</span>trees, which on the Sea doe yeeld a delectable prospect: It was one of the seaven
Churches, Revel. 2. 1. This <span class="right-marginnote">[V. 175.]</span>was one of the most renowned Cities in Asia the lesser but the same thereof arose
from the Temple of Diana: which for the spaciousnesse, furniture, and magnificent
workmanship was accounted one of the seven worlds wonders: It was two hundred yeares
in building, being foure hundred twenty five foote long, and two hundred broad: It
was seven severall times burnt, whereof the most part was with lightning, and lastly
the finall destruction of it, came by a base fellow Erostratus, who to purchase himselfe
a name, <span class="marginnote"><i>Dianaes Temple burnt.</i></span>did set it on fire. Timothy was Bishop of Ephesus, to the people whereof, Saint Paul
directed one of his Epistles, and finally it is famous for the buriall of Saint John
the Evangelist: It was said of this place, in the Acts of the Apostles, that all Asia,
and the whole world did worship here Diana: Tully reporteth, De natura Deorum, that
Timæus being demanded the reason why the Temple of Diana was set on fire that night,
when Alexander the great was borne: gave this jest thereof, that the Mistresse of
it was from home; because she being the Goddesse of Midwives, did that night wait
upon Olimpias the mother of Alexander the great, who was brought to bed in Macedonia.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The Ile Lango or Cuos.</i></span>Over against this Citie is the Ile Lango, aunciently called Coos, wherein the great
Hippocrates was borne, and Appelles, the Painter most excellent. It is both fertile,
and populous, and of circuite above fourescore miles. There is a kind of Serpent said
to be in it, so friendly unto the Inhabitants, that when the men are sleeping under
the shadow of trees, they come cralling, and will lincke or claspe themselves about
their neckes and bodies, without doing any harme, neither when they awake are the
beasts affraid.
</p>
<p>And neare to Lango, is the Ile Nixa, of old Strangoli; <span class="right-marginnote">[V. 176.]</span>and by some called Dronisa and Naxus, an Iland both fruitfull and delightfull. As
we sailed by the West part of the Ile, a Greekish passenger shewed me the place, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158">158</a>]</span>where (as he sayd) Ariadne was deceived of Theseus, which is not farre from the irriguate
plaine of Darmille.
</p>
<p>Continuing our Navigation, I saw the little Ile Ephdosh, where the Turkes told me,
that all the Ilanders were <span class="marginnote"><i>Excellent swimmers.</i></span>naturally good swimmers, paying no more tribute to their great Lord the Turke, save
onely once in the yeare there are certaine men, and women chosen by a Turkish Captaine,
who must swimme a whole league right out in the Sea, and goe downe to the bottome
of the waters, to fetch thence some token they have got ground: And if they shall
happen to faile in this, the Iland will be reduced againe to pay him yearely rent.
This I saw with mine eyes, whiles we being calmed, there came a man and two women
swimming to us, more then a mile of way, carrying with them (drie above the water)
baskets of fruite to sell, the which made me not a little to wonder. For when they
came to the ships side, they would neither boord, nor boat with us, but lay leaning,
or as it were resting them selves on the sea, upon their one side, and sold so their
fruits: keeping complements and discourses with us above an houre. Contenting them
for their ware, and a fresh gale arising, we set forward, accoasting the little Ile
of Samothracia.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Samothracia.</i></span>This Ile of Samothracia, was called of old Dardania, and now by the Turkes Samandracho;
a place of small note considering the quantity of the Ile, and the few number of Inhabitants:
their lives being answerable to their meannes; ignorance and servitude; two strong
commanders of infirme weaklings, and no lesse powerfull, then <span class="right-marginnote">[V. 177.]</span>they are debile in the debt of worthinesse; which the younglings of understanding,
&amp; sucklings of far look&#x2019;d-to knowledge, can never be able to escape, although a true
profession covereth many naturall imperfections; and in it a hope for blessednes,
which indeed moe wish for, then rightly understand it. And upon the ninth day after
our departure from Smyrna, we arrived at the City of Rhodes, so called of the Iland
wherein it standeth.
</p>
<p>Rhodes lieth in the Carpathian Sea. It was of old called <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159">159</a>]</span><span class="marginnote"><i>The Ile of Rhodes.</i></span>Ithrea, Telchino, and Phiula: Plinie saith it was called Rhodes, because there were
certaine fields of Roses in it; for Rhodos in the Greeke tongue signifieth a Flower:
Not farre from the City, and at the entery of the Haven, <span class="marginnote"><i>The Idoll Collossus.</i></span>I saw the relicts of that huge, and admiredly erected Idoll, named Colossus Rhodius,
or the mighty image of the Sunne; which was made in honour thereof: from the which
Saint Paul termed the Inhabitants Collossians. It was builded by the worthy Canete
Lindo in the space of twelve yeares: others have said, of Callasses the Disciple of
Lisippus, taking the name Collossus of him, and it was thought worthy to be one of
the seven earthly wonders, and so it might justly have beene: The quantity whereof
(as yet) may amaze the minde of the beholder: It was erected in the Image of a man,
being eighty cubits high, and so bigge, that the little finger of it was as bigge
as an ordinary man: between whose legs, (it standing in the harbours mouth, with a
legge on each side of the entery) Shippes were wont to passe under with taunt sayles:
When Mnavi Generall of Caliph Osmen first united this Ile to the Mahometan Empire,
and broke downe the greatest part of this statue; the brasse whereof was said to be
so much that it loaded nine hundred Camells.
</p>
<p>This Ile belonged once to the Knights of Malta, and <span class="right-marginnote">[V. 178.]</span>were then surnamed Knights of the Rhodes, but they came first out of Acre in the Holy
Land; who were called Knights of St. John; who viriliously expulsed the Saracens from
thence, Anno 1308. who had formerly taken it from the devided Grecians: These Knights
sorely invested the Turkes for the space of two hundred yeares, till Solyman the magnificent,
at last invaded and subdued it: The Rhodians were ever great friends to the Romanes,
insomuch that when all the other Mediterranean Ilands revolted to Mithridates of Pontus,
this onely adhered to the Romanes.
</p>
<p>This Ile of Rhodes within the space of 25. yeares was three times mightily indangered
by violent and extreame <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160">160</a>]</span><span class="marginnote"><i>Inundation of waters.</i></span>impetuosities of raine: in such sort that the last flood did drowne the greatest part
of the Inhabitants: which beginning in the Spring-time, did continue to Summer, and
in all this time, it broke violently downe their houses, and in the night killed the
people lying in their beds; and in the day time such as were sheltered under safegard
of their dwellings: which was a miserable destruction, and the like of it scarcely
heard of since the universall deludge.
</p>
<p>But true it is, as these ominous judgements falling upon particular parts &amp; parcells
of people, are justly executed; yet they serve for Caveats for all others in generall,
(sinne being the originall of all) to take heed of offending the Creator, in abusing
the best use of the Creature.
</p>
<p>The Citie of Rhodes hath two strong Fortresses, in one of which these Knights (Lilladamus
Villiers being great Master, who were about five hundred onely, and five thousand
Rhodians who asisted them) were besieged by an Armie of two hundred thousand Turkes,
and three hundred Galleys, for the space of sixe months. The chiefe <span class="right-marginnote">[V. 179.]</span>obstacle, and impeaching of so great an Army from taking it, was onely the resolute
valour of the defendants. But in end multitude overmastring valour, and the Cavalieri
di Rhodo, wanting furniture to their munition, and being penurious of victuals, were
constrayned to render, upon the conditionall safety of their lives, goods, and transportation;
and remained a long time without any habitation, till the King of Spaine gave them
the barren Ile of Malta to inhabite: This Ile of Rhodes was lost by the Maltezes,
Anno Dom. 1522. <span class="marginnote"><i>Rhodes taken by Solyman.</i></span>And on Christmas day Solyman entred the Towne as conquerour, though he might justly
have said (as Pyrhus once said of his victory over the Romanes) that such another
victory would utterly have undone him; he lost so many of his bravest Commanders,
and best Souldiers. It is ever since in the fruition of Turkes: The Fortresse of Rhodes,
and that Fortresse Famogusta, in Cyprus, are the two strongest holds, in all the Empire
of the great Turke.
</p>
<p>And by the way here I must record, that if the great <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161">161</a>]</span>Turke, and his great Counsell, were not good pay-masters to their Janizaries, and
speedy rewarders of their common Souldiers; it were impossible for him the Emperour,
or them the Bassawes to menage so great a state, and to keepe under obedience so head-strong
a multitude, &amp; such turbulent forces: for by your leave, <span class="marginnote"><i>Souldiers should be regarded &amp; rewarded.</i></span>if a Souldiers industry be not quickned and animated with bountifull rewards; he hath
lesse will to performe any part of Martiall service; then a dead coarse hath power
to arise out of the grave: for what can be more precious to man, then his blood, being
the fountaine &amp; nurse of his vitall spirits, &amp; the ground of his bodily substance;
which no free or ingenious nature wil hazard to lose for nothing.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[V. 180.]</span>And whosoever shall argument or discourse upon sound reason, and infallible experience,
may easily prove and perceive, that these Commanders have ever best prospered, which
have most liberally maintayned, and had in singular regard, Military Arts and Souldiers;
otherwise the honourable mind, would account it a great deale better to have death
without life, then life without reward: yea, and the noble Commander, desiring rather
to want, then to suffer worth unrecompensed.
</p>
<p>Rhodes joyneth neare to the continent, over against Caria, now called Carmania, under
which name the Turkes comprehend Pamphilia, Ionia, and Lycia: Caria by the Sea side,
hath Lycia to the South, and Caria to the North: The chiefe Cities are Manissa, and
Mindum, which having great gates, being but a small Towne, made Diogenes the Cynick
crie out. Yee Citizens of Mindum, take heed, that your City run not out of your gates:
The third is Hallicarnasso, where Dionisius was borne, who writ the History of Rome
for the first three hundred yeares: Of which Towne also the Province tooke the name;
for Artemisia, who ayded Xerxes against the Grecians, was by some Authors named Queene
of Hallicarnasso. This was she, <span class="marginnote"><i>Mausolaos Tombe.</i></span>who in honour of her husband Mausolao, built that curious Sepulcher, accounted for
one of the worlds <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162">162</a>]</span>wonders; it being twenty five cubits high, and supported with thirty sixe admirable
wrought pillars.
</p>
<p>After I had contented the Master for my fraught, and victuals (who as he was an Infidell,
used me with great exaction) I found a Barke of the Arches purposed to Cyprus, with
the which I imbarked, being foure hundred miles distant.
</p>
<p>This Tartareta, or Demi galleyeot, belonged to the Ile of Stagiro, aunciently Thasia,
wherein there were <span class="right-marginnote">[V. 181.]</span>mines of gold, in these times that afforded yearely to Philip King of Macedon, about
fourescore talents of gold, but now mightily impoverished and of no consequence: The
chiefe Towne whereof is Palmapreto, where diverse Greekes hold the opinion, Homer
was interred, having a famous Sea-port, which is a common resting place for all the
Orientall Pirats or Cursaroes; which maketh the Ile halfe desolate of people; and
these few scarce worthy of their dwellings.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Pamphilia &amp; Lycia.</i></span>Having past the gulfe of Sattelia, and the Ile Carpathia, whence that part of the
Sea taketh his name: we boorded close along the coast of Lycia, and the firme land
of fruitfull Pamphilia; the chiefe Citie of Lycia is Patras, watred with the river
Zanthus, whence the people were called Zanthi, afterward Lycians of Lycus sonne to
Pandion: It lieth twixt Caria and Pamphilia, as Pamphilia lyeth betweene it and Cilicia:
The chiefe Towne in Pamphilia is Seleucia, built by Seleucus, one of Alexanders successours:
on the East of Lycia within land bordreth Lycaonia, &amp;c. Having left Pamphilia behind
us, we fetched up the coast of Cylicia, sustaining many great dangers, both of tempestuous
stormes, and invasions of damnable Pirats, who gave us divers assaults to their owne
disadvantages; our saylage being swifter, then either their swallowing desires could
follow, or our weake and inresolute defence could resist.
</p>
<p>Here in this Countrey of Cilicia, was Saint Paul borne in the now decayed Towne of
Tharsus, who for antiquity will not succumbe to any City of Natolia, being as yet
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163">163</a>]</span>the Mistresse of that Province, though neither for worth, nor wealth.

<p class="first">Twelve dayes was I betweene Rhodes and Limisse in <span class="marginnote"><i>The description of Cyprus.</i></span>Cyprus; where arrived, I received more gracious demonstrations from the Ilanders,
then I could hope for, or wish, being farre beyond my merit or expectation; onely
contenting my curiosity with a quiet mind, I redounded thankes for my imbraced courtesies.
</p>
<p>The people are generally strong and nimble, of great civility, hospitality to their
neighbours, and exceedingly affectionated to strangers. The second day after my arrival,
I tooke with me an Interpreter, and went to see Nicosia, which is placed in the midst
of the Kingdome. But in my journey thither, extreame was the heate and thirst I endured;
both in respect of the season, and also want of water: And although I had with me
sufficiency of Wine, yet durst I drinke none thereof, being so strong, and withall
had a tast of pitch; and that is, because they have no barrels, but great Jarres made
of earth, wherein their Wine is put. And these Jarres are all inclosed within the
ground save onely their mouthes, which stand alwayes open like to a Source or Cisterne;
whose insides are all interlarded with pitch to preserve the earthen vessells unbroke
a sunder, in regard of the forcible Wine; yet making the taste thereof unpleasant
to liquorous lips; and turneth the Wine, too headdy for the braine in digestion, which
for health groweth difficult to strangers; and to themselves a swallowing up of diseases.

<p class="first">Nicosia is the principall Citie of Cyprus, and is invironed with mountaines, like
unto Florence in Ætruria; <span class="marginnote"><i>The sixe Cities of Cyprus.</i></span>wherein the Beglerbeg remaineth: The second is Famegusta, the chiefe strength and
Sea-port in it: Selina, Lemisso, Paphos, and Fontana Morosa, are the other foure speciall
Townes in the Iland.
</p>
<p>This Ile of Cyprus was of old called Achametide, Amatusa, and by some Marchara, that
is happy: It is of length extending from East to West, 210. large 60. and of circuit
600. miles. It yeeldeth infinite canes of Sugar, Cotten-wooll, Oyle, Honney, Cornes,
Turpentine, Allum, Verdegreece, Grogranes, store of Mettals and Salt; besides all
other sorts of fruit and commodities in abundance. It was also named Cerastis, because
it butted toward the East with one horne: and lastly Cyprus, from the abundance of
Cypresse trees there growing. This Iland was consecrated to Venus, where in Paphos
she was greatly honoured, termed hence, Dea Cypri,

<p class="first">Cyprus lyeth in the gulfe betweene Cilicia and Syria, having Ægypt to the West: Syria
to the South: Cilicia to the East: and the Pamphilian Sea to the North: It hath foure
chiefe Capes or headlands: first, Westward the Promontore of Acanias, modernely Capo
di Santo Epifanio: to the South the Promontore Phæuria, now Capo Bianco: to the East
Pedasia, modernely Capo di <span class="right-marginnote">[V. 184.]</span>Greco: to the North, the high foreland of Cramineon, now Capo di Cormathita: these
foure are the chiefest Promontores of the Iland, and Cape di S. Andrea <span class="corr" id="xd29e4287" title="Source: in">is</span> the furthest poynt Eastward toward Cilicia: Diodore and Pliny say that anciently
it contained nine Kingdomes, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165">165</a>]</span>and fifteene good Townes: Cerania, now Selina, was built by Cyrus, who subdued the
nine petty Kings of this Ile: Nicosia is situate in the bottome or plaine of Massara,
and thirty foure miles from Famagusta; and the Towne of Famagusta was formerly named
Salamus: I was informed by some of sound experience here, that this Kingdome containeth
about eight hundreth and forty Villages, besides the sixe capitall Townes, two whereof
are nothing inferiour for greatnesse and populosity to the best Townes in Candy, Sicily,
or Greece.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Trohodos a huge hill in Cyprus.</i></span>The chiefest and highest mountaine in this Ile, is by the Cypriots called Trohodos,
it is of height eight, and of compasse forty eight miles, whereon there are a number
of Religious Monasteries, the people whereof are called Colieros, and live under the
order of Saint Basile. There is abundance here of Coriander seede, with medicinable
Reubarbe, and Turpentine. Here are also mines of gold in it, of Chrysocole, of Calthante,
of Allome, Iron, and exceeding good Copper. And besides these mines, there are diverse
precious stones found in this Ile, as Emeraulds, Diamonds, Chrystall, Corall, red
and white, and the admirable stone Amiante, whereof they make Linnen cloth, that will
not burne being cast into the fire, but serveth to make it neate and white.
</p>
<p>The greatest imperfection of this Ile, is scarcity of water, and too much plenty of
scorching heate, and fabulous grounds. The Inhabitants are very civill, courteous,
and affable; and notwithstanding of their <span class="right-marginnote">[V. 185.]</span>delicious and delicate fare, they are much subject to Melancholy, of a Robust nature,
and good Warriours, if they might carry Armes: It is recorded, that in the time of
Constantine the Great, this Ile was all uterly abandoned of the Inhabitants, and that
because it did not raine for the space of sixe and thirty yeares. After which time,
and to <span class="marginnote"><i>Cyprus replanted.</i></span>replant this Region againe, the chiefest Colonies came from Ægypt, Judea, Syria, Cilicia,
Pamphilia, Thracia, and certaine Territories of Greece: And it is thought, in the
yeares 1163. after that Guy of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166">166</a>]</span>Lusingham, the last Christian King of Jerusalem had lost the Holy Land, a number of
French men, stayed and inhabited here; of whom sprung the greatest race of the Cyprian
Gentility; and so from them are discended the greatest Families of the Phenician Sydonians,
modernely Drusians: though ill divided, and worse declined; yet they are sprung both
from one Originall: the distraction arising from Conscience of Religion, the one a
Christian, the other a Turke.
</p>
<p>The three Iles of Cyprus, Candy, and Sicily, are the onely Monarchicke Queenes of
the Mediterranean Seas: <span class="marginnote"><i>Comparisons of Iles.</i></span>and semblable to other in fertility, length, breadth, and circuit: save onely Candy
that is somewhat more narrow then the other two, and also more Hilly and sassinous:
yet for Oyles and Wines, she is the Mother of both the other: Sicily being for Graine
and Silkes the Empresse of all: and Cyprus for Sugar and Cotton-wooll, a darling sister
to both; onely Sicily being the most civill Ile, and nobly gentilitat, the Cypriots
indifferently good, and the Candiots the most ruvid of all.
</p>
<p>The chiefe Rivers are Teno, and Pedesco: Cyprus was first by Teucer made a Kingdome,
who after the Trojane Warre came and dwelt here: and afterward being divided <span class="right-marginnote">[V. 186.]</span>betweene nine petty Princes, it was subdued by Cyrus, the first Monarch of the Meedes
and Persians. After the subversion of which Empire, this Ile was given to the Potolomies
of Ægypt: from whom Cato conquered it to the benefit of the Romans. <span class="marginnote"><i>The Dukes of Savoy were Kings of Cyprus.</i></span>The Dukes of Savoy were once Kings of Cyprus; but the Inhabitants usurping their authority,
elected Kings to themselves, of their owne generation: and so it continued, till the
last King of Cyprus, James the Bastard (marrying with the daughter of a noble Venetian,
Catherina Cornaro) died without children, leaving her his absolute heire. And she
perceiving the factious Nobility, too headstrong to be bridled by a female authority,
like a good child, resigned her Crowne and Scepter to the Venetian Senate, Anno 1473.
Whereupon the Venetians imbracing the opportunitie of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167">167</a>]</span>time, brought her home, and sent Governours thither to beare sway in their behalfe;
paying onely as tribute to the Ægyptian Sultans 40000. Crownes, which had been due
ever since Melecksala, had made John of Cyprus his tributary.
</p>
<p>It was under their Jurisdiction 120. yeares and more; till that the Turkes, who ever
oppose themselves against Christians (finding a fit occasion in time of peace, and
without suspition in the Venetians) tooke it in with a great Armado. Anno 1570. and
so till this day by them is detayned. Oh great pitty! that the usurpers of Gods word,
and the worlds great enemy, should maintaine (without feare) that famous Kingdome,
being but one thousand &amp; fifty Turkes in all, who are the keepers of it: unspeakable
is the calamitie of that poore afflicted Christian people under the terrour of these
Infidels; who would, if they had Armes, or asistance of any Christian Potentate, easily
subvert and abolish the Turkes, without <span class="right-marginnote">[V. 187.]</span>any disturbance; yea, and would render the whole Signiory thereof to such a noble
Actor. I doe not see in that small judgement, which by experience I have got, but
the redemption of that Countrey were most facile; if that the generous heart of any
Christian Prince, would be moved with condigne compassion to relieve the miserable
aflicted Inhabitants. In which worke, he should reape (questionlesse) not onely an
infinite treasure of Worldly commodities, that followeth upon so great a conquest,
but also a heavenly and eternall reward of immortall glory. <span class="marginnote"><i>The Florentines attempted to conquer Cyprus.</i></span>The which deliverance Ferdinando Duke of Florence, thought to have accomplished (having
purchased the good will of the Ilanders) with five Gallounes, and 5000. Souldiers:
Who being mindfull to take first in the Fortresse of Famogusta, directed so their
course, that in the night, they should have entred the Haven, disbarke their men,
and scale the walles.
</p>
<p>But in this plot they were farre disappointed by an unhappy Pilot of the Vice-admirall,
who mistaking the Port, went into a wrong bay: which the Florentines considering,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168">168</a>]</span>resolved to returne, and keepe the sea, till the second night; but by a dead calme,
they were frustrated of their aymes, and on the morrow discovered by the Castle: Whereupon
the Turkes went presently to armes, &amp; charged the Inhabitants to come to defend that
place: But about foure hundred Greekes in the West part, at Paphos, rebelled; thinking
that time had altered their hard fortunes, by a new change: but alas, they were prevented,
&amp; every one cut off by the bloody hands of the Turkes. This massacre was committed
in the yeare 1607. Such alwaies are the torturing flames of Fortunes smiles, that
he who most affecteth her, she most, and altogether deceiveth: But they who trust
in the Lord, shall be as <span class="right-marginnote">[V. 188.]</span>stable as Mount Syon, which cannot be removed; and questionlesse, one day God, in
his all-eternall mercie, will relieve their miseries, and in his just judgements,
recompence these bloody oppressors with the heavy vengeance of his all-seeing Justice.
</p>
<p>In my returne from Nicosia, to Famogusta, with my Trench-man, we encountered by the
way with foure Turkes, who needs would have my Mule to ride upon; which my Interpreter
refused: But they in a revenge, pulled me by thee heeles from the Mules backe, beating
me most pittifully, and left me almost for dead. In this meanewhile my companion fled,
and escaped the sceleratnesse of their hands; and if it had not beene for some compassionable
Greekes, who by accident came by, and relieved me, I had doubtlesse immediately perished.
</p>
<p>Here I remember betweene this Ile and Sydon that same Summer, there were five galleouns
of the Duke of <span class="marginnote"><i>A sea cumbat.</i></span>Florence, who encountred by chance the Turkes great Armado consisting of 100. gallies,
14. galleots, and two galleasses: The Admirall of which ships did single out her selfe
from the rest, and offered to fight with the whole Armado alone; but the Turkes durst
not, and in their flying backe, the Admirall sunke two of their gallies; and had almost
seazed upon one of their galleasses, if it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169">169</a>]</span>had not beene for 20. gallies, who desperatly adventured to row her away against the
wind and so escaped.
</p>
<p>For true it is, the naturall Turkes were never skilfull in menaging of Sea battells,
neither are they expert Mariners, nor experimented Gunners, if it were not for our
Christian Runnagates, French, English, and Flemings, and they too sublime, accurate,
and desperate fellowes; who have taught the Turkes the airt of navigation, and especially
the use of munition; which they both cast to <span class="right-marginnote">[V. 189.]</span>them, &amp; then become their chiefe Cannoniers; the Turkes would be as weake and ignorant
at sea, as the silly Æthiopian, is unexpert in handling of armes on the Land. <span class="marginnote"><i>Christiane Runagates.</i></span>For the private humour of discontented castawayes is alwaies an enemy to publicke
good, who from the society of true beleevers, are driven to the servitude of Infidells,
and refusing the bridle of Christian correction, they receive the double yoake of
dispaire and condemnation. Whose terrour of a guilty conscience, or rather blazing
brand of their vexed soules, in forsaking their Faith, and denying Christ to be their
Saviour, ramverts most of them, either over in a torment of melancholy, otherwise
in the extasie of madnesse: which indeed is a torturing horrour, that is sooner felt
then knowne; and cannot be avoided by the rudenesse of nature, but by the saving grace
of true felicity.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The City of Tripoly.</i></span>From the Fort and City Famogusta, I imbarked in a Germo, and arrived at Tripoly being
88. miles distant, where I met with an English ship called the Royall Exchange of
London, lying there at Anker in the dangerous Road of Tripoly, whose loves I cannot
easily forget, for at my last good night, being after great cheare, and greater carrousing,
they gave me the thundring farewell of three pieces of Ordonance. Tripoly is a City
in Syria, standing a mile from the marine side, neere to the foot of Mount Libanus:
since it hath beene first founded, it hath three times beene situated, and removed
in three sundry places: First it was overwhelmed with water: Secondly, it was sacked
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170">170</a>]</span>with Cursares, and Pirates: Thirdly, it is like now to be overthrowne with new made
mountaines of sand: There is no haven by many miles neere unto it, but a dangerous
roade, where often when Northerly winds blow, ships are cast away.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[V. 190.]</span><span class="marginnote"><i>Scanderona.</i></span>The great Traffique which now is at this place, was formerly at Scanderona or Alexandretta,
a little more Eastward; but by reason of the infectious ayre, that corrupted the bloud
of strangers, proceeding of two high Mountaines; who are supposed to be a part of
Mount Caucasus, which withhold the prospect of the Sunne from the In-dwellers, more
then three howers in the morning. So that in my knowledge, I have knowne dye in one
ship, and a moneths time, twenty Marriners: for this cause the Christian ships were
glad to have their commodities brought to Tripoly, which is a more wholesome and convenient
place.
</p>
<p>The dayly interrogation I had here, for a Carravans departure to Aleppo, was not to
me a little fastidious, being mindfull to visite Babylon: In this my expectation I
tooke purpose, with three Venetian Merchants, to go see the Cedars of Libanon, which
was but a dayes journey thither. As we ascended upon the mountaine, our ignorant guide
mistaking the way, brought us in a Laborinth of dangers; Insomuch that wrestling amongst
intricate paths of Rockes: two of our Asses fell over a banke, and broke their neckes:
And if it had not bene for a Christian Amaronite, who accidently encountred with us,
in our wilesome wandring, we had bene miserably lost: both in regard of Rockes, and
heapes of snow we passed; and also of great Torrents, which fell downe with force,
from the steepy tops: wherein one of these Merchants was twice almost drowned. When
we arrived <span class="marginnote"><i>The Cedars of Libanus.</i></span>to the place where the Cedars grew, we saw but twenty foure of all, growing after
the manner of Oke-trees, but a great deale taler, straighter, and greater, and the
braunches grow so straight, and interlocking as though they were kept by Arte. And
yet from the Roote to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171">171</a>]</span><span class="right-marginnote">[V. 191.]</span>toppe they beare no boughes, but grow straight upward, like to a Palme-tree; who as
may-poles invelope the ayre, so their circle spred tops, do kisse or enhance the lower
cloudes; making their grandure over-looke the highest bodies of all other aspiring
trees: and like Monarchick Lyons to wild beasts, they become the chiefe Champions
of Forrests and Woods.
</p>
<p>Although that in the dayes of Salomon, this mountaine was over-clad with Forrests
of Cedars, yet now there are but onely these, and nine miles Westward thence, seventeene
more. The nature of that tree is alwayes greene, yeelding an odoriferous smell, and
an excellent kind of fruite like unto Apples, but of a sweeter taste, and more wholesome
in digestion. The Rootes of some of these Cedars are almost destroyed by Sheepheards,
who have made fires thereat, and holes wherein they sleepe; yet neverthelesse they
flourish greene above in the tops, and branches. The length of this mountaine is about
forty miles, reaching from the West, to the East: and continually, Summer and Winter,
reserveth Snow on the tops. It is also beautified with all the ornaments of nature,
as Herbage, Tillage, Pastorage, Fructiferous Trees, fine Fountaines, good Cornes,
and absolutely the best Wine that is bred on the earth. <span class="marginnote"><i>The Prince of Libanus.</i></span>The Signior thereof is a Freeholder, by birth a Turke, and will not acknowledge any
superiour, being the youngest sonne of the Emeere or Prince of Sidon, who when his
Father revolted against Achmet, and not being able to make his owne part good, fled
into Italy, to the Duke of Florence: And notwithstanding that the elder brother yeelded
up Sidon, and became a pardond subject to the great Turke: yet this the other brother
would never yeeld nor surrender, himselfe, the Fort, nor the Signiory of Libanus:
The olde <span class="right-marginnote">[V. 192.]</span>Prince his father after two yeares exile, was restored againe to his Emperours favour;
with whom in my second Travels, both at Lygorne and Messina in Sicilee, I rancountred:
whence the Duke of Sona that Kingdomes Viceroy, caused transport him on a stately
ship for the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172">172</a>]</span>Levant to Sidon: The Sidonians or Drusians, were first of all French men, who after
their expulsion from Jerusalem, fled hither to the borders of Zebulon and Nephtalim,
now called Phenicia, as I shall make more cleere afterwards.
</p>
<p>The most part of the inhabited villages are Christians, <span class="marginnote"><i>Nestorians.</i></span>called Amaronites, or Nostranes, quasi Nazaritans, and are governed by their owne
Patriarke. There are none at this day, do speake the Syriack tongue, save onely these
people of mount Libanus; and in that language the Alcoran of Mahomet is written. The
kinde Amaronite whom we met, and tooke with us for our best guide, in descending from
the Cedars shewed us many caves and Holes in Rockes, where Coliers, religious Siriens
and Amaronites abide: Amongst these austere Cottages, I saw <span class="marginnote"><i>Joshuas Tombe.</i></span>a faire Tombe all of one stone, being 17. foote of length; which (as he said) was
the Sepulcher of the valiant Joshua, who conducted the people of Israel to the land
of promise.
</p>
<p>The Mahometans esteeme this to be a holy place, and many resort to it in Pilgrimage,
to offer up their Satanicall Prayers to Mahomet. I saw upon this Mountaine, a sort
of fruite, called Amazza Franchi: that is, The death of Christians; because when Italians,
and others of Europe, eate any quantity thereof, they presently fall into the bloudy
fluxe, or else ingender some other pestilentious fever, whereof they dye.
</p>
<p>The Patriarke did most kindly entertaine us at his <span class="right-marginnote">[V. 193.]</span>house; so did also all the Amaronites of the other Villages, who met us in our way
before we came to their Townes, and brought presents with them of Bread, Wine, Figges,
Olives, Sallets, Capons, Egges, and such like, as they could on a sudden provide.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The Bishop of Eden on Libanus.</i></span>This Bishop or Patriarkes house, is joyned with and hembd in, within the face of an
high Rocke, that serveth for three sides thereof, the fore and fourth part being onely
of Mason-worke: Neare unto which falleth precipitatly a great Torrent over the sassinous
banke, that maketh a greivous noyse night and day: which as I told <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173">173</a>]</span>him, me thought it should turne the Bishop Surdo or starke deafe: But the homely and
simple man (not puft with ambition greed, and glorious apparrell, like to our proud
Prelats of Christendome) told me, that continuall custome brought him to despose upon
the day, and sleepe better in the night, because of the sounding waters. Where reposing
with him one night, my Muse the next morning saluted Libanus with these lines.

</div>
<p class="first"><span class="marginnote"><i>The Nestorian paradice.</i></span>About the Village of Eden, is the most fruitfull part of all Libanus, abounding in
all sorts of delicious fruits. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174">174</a>]</span>True it is, the variety of these things, maketh the silly people thinke, the Garden
of Eden was there: By which allegeance, they approve the apprehension of such a sinistrous
opinion with these arguments, that Mount Libanus is sequestrate from the circum-jacent
Regions, and is invincible for the height, and strengths they have in Rocks; and that
Eden was still reedified by the fugitive Inhabitants, when their enemies had ransacked
it: Also they affirme before the deluge it was so nominate, and after the flood it
was repaired againe by Japhet, the sonne of Noah, who builded Joppa, or Japhta in
Palestina. Loe there are the reasons they shew strangers for such like informations.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The Georgians Paradice.</i></span>
</p>
<p>There are with this one, other two supposed places of the earthly Paradice: The one
is by the Turkes, and some ignorant Georgians, holden to be at Damascus, for the beauty
of faire fields, gardens, and excellent fruits there; <span class="right-marginnote">[V. 195.]</span>especially for the tree called <span class="marginnote"><i>The Tree Mouslee.</i></span>Mouslee, which they beleeve hath growne there since the beginning of the world. Indeed
it is a rare and singular tree, for I saw it at Damascus, and others also of the same
kind, upon Nylus in Ægypt: The growth whereof is strange: for every yeare in September
it is cut downe hard by the roote, and in five moneths the tree buddeth up a pace
againe, bringing forth leaves, flowers, and fruite. The leafe thereof is of such a
breadth, that three men may easily stand under the shadow of it, and the Apple is
bigger then a foot-ball, which is yearely transported for Constantinople to the great
Turke; and there is reserved for a relict of the fruit of the forbidden tree; whence
he surstyles himselfe keeper of the earthly Paradice.
</p>
<p>But if he were not surer a greater commander and reserver of a large part of the best
bosome of the earth, than he is keeper of that Adamian Garden; his styles of the earth,
and mine of the world, were both alike, and that were just nothing, save onely this,
two naked creatures living amongst naked people: or otherwise, if <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175">175</a>]</span>it were to be kept or seene, certainely I would wish to be a Postillion, to the great
Porter, the Turke, but not his Pedagog, farre lesse his Pilgrime.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The Chelfane Paradice.</i></span>The third place by the Chelfaines, is thought to be in the East part of Mesopotamia,
neere to the joyning of Tygris, and Euphrates; where, so they inhabite: I have oft
required of these Chelfaines, what reason they had for this conceived opinion: who
answered me, they received it from time to time, by the tradition of their Ancestors:
And because of the river Euphrates, and other rivers mentioned in the Scriptures,
which to this day, detayne their names in that Countrey. Some hold, that Garden of
Eden extended over all the earth. But contrariwise, <span class="right-marginnote">[V. 196.]</span>it manifestly appeareth by the second Chapter of Genesis, 2. 20. that this garden,
that we call Paradice, wherein Adam was put to dresse it, was a certaine place on
earth, containing a particular portion of a Countrey, called Eden, which boundeth
on the river Euphrates. To this, and all the rest, I answer, no certainty can be had
of the place where Eden was, either by reading or travelling, because this river hath
beene oft divided in sundry streames: And it is said, that Cyrus, when he wonne Babylon,
did turne the maine channell of Euphrates to another course. But howsoever, or wheresoever
it be, I resolve my selfe, no man can demonstrate the place, which God for the sinnes
and fall of man, did not onely accurse; but also the whole face of the earth.
</p>
<p>Many ancient Authors have agreed with the opinion of Plato and Aristotle, constantly
affirming, that mountaines, Ilands, and Countries, have received great alteration
by <span class="marginnote"><i>Violence of Seas &amp; waters.</i></span>the inundation of Rivers, and violence of raging Seas. Thracia, hath beene divided
from Bithinia: Nigroponti, from Thessalia: Corfu, from Epire: Sicilia, from Italy:
The Iles Orcades, from Scotland, and many other Ilands, and Countries cut through
so in divisions after the same forme. Wherefore the more a man contemplate to search
the knowledge of Eden, and such high misteries (appertaining onely to the Creator)
the more he shall faile in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176">176</a>]</span>his purpose, offend God, become foolish, and fantasticall for his paines.
</p>
<p>But to turne backe to mine itinerary relation, after my returne to Tripoly, I departed
thence Eastward, with a Caravan of Turkes to Aleppo, being ten dayes journey distant.
In all this way (leaving Scanderon on our left hand) I saw nothing worthy remarking;
save onely a few scattered Villages, and poore miserable people called Turcomani,
living in Tents, and following their flockes <span class="right-marginnote">[V. 197.]</span>to whom I payed sundry Caffars who remove their women, children, and cattell where
so they finde fountaines, and good pastorage: like unto the custome of the ancient
Israelites: Which in their vagabonding fashion, did plainely demonstrate the necessity
they had to live, rather then any pleasure they had, or could have in their living.
</p>
<p>They differ also in Religion from all the other Mahometans in two damnable points:
<span class="marginnote"><i>The Turcomans opinion of God &amp; the Divell.</i></span>The one is, they acknowledge, that there is a God, and that he of him selfe is so
gracious, that he neither can, being essentially good doe harme, nor yet will authorize
any ill to be done, and therefore more to be loved than feared: The other is, they
confesse there is a Divell, and that he is a tormentor of all evill doers: and of
himselfe so terrible and wicked, that they are contented even for acquisting his favour
and kindnesse, to sacrifice in fire their first borne child to him: soliciting his
divellishnes, not to torment them too sore when they shall come into his hands: And
yet for all this, they thinke afterwards by the mercy of Mahomet, they shall goe from
hell to Paradice.
</p>
<p>In this immediate or aforesayd passage, we coasted neare and within sixe miles of
the limits of Antiochia, <span class="marginnote"><i>Antiochians the first Christians.</i></span>one of the ancient Patriarch seas; so called of Antiochus her first founder, and not
a little glorying to this day, that the Disciples of Jesus and Antiochians were first
here named Christians. Who (nothwithstanding) of their grievous afflictions flourished
so that in 40. yeares they grew a terrour to their enemies; who suggested by the Divell
cruelly afflicted them with ten generall persecutions, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177">177</a>]</span>under the Emperours, Nero anno 67. Domitianus, anno 96, Trajanus, 100. Maximinius,
137. Marcus Antonius, <span class="right-marginnote">[V. 198.]</span>167. Severus, 195. Decius, 250. Valerianus, 259. Aurelianus, 278. and Dioclesian anno
293. yeares. Notwithstanding all which massacres and martyrdome, yet this little graine
of Mustard seed, planted by Gods owne hand, and watered with the blood of so many
holy Saints, (Nam sanguis Martirum, semen Ecclesiæ est) grew so great a tree, that
the branches thereof were dispersed through every City, and Province of the whole
world.
</p>
<p>Before my arrivall in Aleppo, the Caravan of Babylon was from thence departed, which
bred no small griefe in my breast: The Venetian Consull, to whom I was highly recommended,
by the aforesaid Merchants, (having had some insight of my intended voyage) informed
me, that the Caravan stayed at Beershake on Euphrates, for some conceived report they
had of Arabs, that lay for them in the desarts, and willed me to hire a Janisary,
and three Souldiers to overhye them; whose counsell I received, <span class="marginnote"><i>Frustrate of Babylon.</i></span>But was meerely frustrated of my designes. True it was, they staied, but were gone
three dayes before my comming to that unhappy place.
</p>
<p>The distance from whence over land to Babylon, or Bagdat, being but sixe small or
short dayes journey, the losse whereof and the damnable deceit of my Janizary made
my Muse to expresse, what my sorrowfull Prose can not performe.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">

</div>
<p class="first">In the eleven dayes journey I had betweene Aleppo, and Beershack, through a part of
Syria, the breadth of Mesopotamia, and Chelfania, a Province of the same, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179">179</a>]</span>joyning with Tigris and Euphrates, and returning the same way againe; I found nothing
worthy of remarkinge save the fertility of the soyle: <span class="marginnote"><i>Mesopotamia.</i></span>which indeed in Mesopotamia, yeeldeth two crops of wheate in the yeare, and for a
Bushell sowing, in diverse places, they recoyle a hundreth againe.
</p>
<p>The countrey it selfe is overcled with infinit Villages, having no eminent Towne of
any note or consequence, except the City of Carahemen the seat of a Beglerbeg, who
commandeth under him fourteene Sanzacks, and twenty sixe thousand Timariots. The people
here are for the most part beleevers in Christ, but alas too silly, untoward, and
ignorant Christians: And yet though without learning, or great understanding therein,
they are wonderfull zealous in their profession, and great sufferers for it also.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Beershack.</i></span>This barbarous Towne of Beershacke, being situate on Euphrates standeth in the Chelfaines
Countrey, and is supposed to have beene Padan-aram, where Laban dwelt, and where Jacob
kept Labans sheepe, though some interpret all Mesopotamia, then to have beene called
Padanaram: from whence North-east, and not farre hence are the demolished fragments
of Ninivie on Tigris, whose very ruines are now come to ruine: The decayes whereof
being much semblable to that sacked Lacedemon in Sparta, or to the stony heapes of
Jerico, the detriments of Thebes, <span class="right-marginnote">[V. 201.]</span>the relicts of Tyrus, or to the finall overthrow of desolate Troy. This Countrey of
Chelfaine, is the place most agreeable with Scripture, where the earthly Paradice
was once set, though now impossible to be found out.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Mesopotamia.</i></span>Mesopotamia is seldome watered with raine, but by the nature of the soile is marvellous
fruitfull: It is bordred with Caldea, on the East: Euphrates on the South: Syria on
the North: and Arabia Petrea on the West. This Aleppo is a City in Syria; the name
of which hath beene so oft changed by Turkes, that the true Antiquity of it, can hardly
be knowne: It is both large and populous, and furnished with all sorts of merchandize,
especially of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180">180</a>]</span>Indigo, and Spices, that are brought over land from Goa, &amp; other places in India,
which draweth a concurrance of all nations to it.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>A notable obedience.</i></span>Here I remember of a notable obedience done to the great Turke, by the great Bassaw
of Aleppo, who was also an Emeere, or hereditary Prince: to wit, the yeare before
my comming hither, he had revolted against his Emperour, and fighting the Bassawes
of Damascus, and Carahemen, overcame them: The yeare following, and in my being there,
the Grand Signior sent from Constantinople a Showse, and two Janisaries in Ambassage
to him: where, when they came to Aleppo, the Bassaw was in his owne Countrey at Mesopotamia:
The messengers make hast after him, but in their journey they met him comming backe
to Aleppo, accompanied with his two sonnes, and sixe hundred Horse-men. Upon the high
way they delivered their message, where he stood still, and heard them: The proffer
of Achmet was, that if he would acknowledge his rebellion, and for that treason committed
send him his head, his eldest Sonne should both inherit <span class="right-marginnote">[V. 202.]</span>his possessions, and Bassawship of Aleppo, otherwise he would come with great forces
in all expedition, and in his proper person he would utterly raze him and all his,
from the face of the earth.
</p>
<p>At which expression, the Bassaw knowing that he was not able to resist the invincible
Armie of his Master, and his owne presence, he dismounted from his horse, and went
to counsell with his sonnes, and nearest friends: where he, and they concluded, it
was best for him to dye, being an old man, to save his race undestroyed, and to keepe
his sonne in his authority and inheritance: This done, the Bassaw went to prayer,
and taking his leave of them all, sate downe upon his knees, where the Showse <span class="marginnote"><i>The Bassa of Aleppo beheaded.</i></span>stroke off his head, putting it in a Boxe, to carry it with him for Constantinople.
The dead corps were carried to Aleppo and honourably buried, for I was an eye witnesse
to that funerall feast: And immediatly thereafter, the Showse by Proclamation and
power from the Emperour, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181">181</a>]</span>fully possessed the sonne in his Fathers lands, offices, Bassawship, and the authority
of all the Easterne Syria, part of Mesopotamia, and the Assyrian Countrey; for this
Bassaw of Aleppo is the greatest in commandement and power of all the other Bassawes
in the Turkes dominions; except the Bassa, or Beglerbeg of Damascus; and yet the former
in hereditary power, farre exceedeth the other; being a free Emeer, and thereupon
a Prince borne: The force of his commandement reacheth to eighteene Sanzacks, and
thirty thousand Timariots, besides Janisaries, and other inferiour souldiers, which
would make up as many more.
</p>
<p>This City is called in the Scriptures Aram-Sobab, 2. Sam. 8. 3. and Aleppo of Alep,
which signifieth milke, whereof there is a great plenty here: There are Pigeons brought
up here as after an incredible manner, who will <span class="right-marginnote">[V. 203.]</span>flie betweene Aleppo, and Babylon, being thirty dayes <span class="marginnote"><i>Flying Pigeons with letters.</i></span>journey distant in forty eight houres: carrying letters and newes, which are tied
about their neckes, to Merchants of both Townes, and from one to another; who onely
are imployed in the time of hasty and needfull intendements; their education to this
tractable expedition is admirable, the flights and arrivals of which I have often
seene in the time of my wintering in Aleppo, which was the second Winter after my
departure from Christendome.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Syria.</i></span>Syria hath on the East Armenia major: On the South Mesopotamia: On the North Cilicia
and the sea: On the West Gallilee and Ph&#x153;nicia: In the Bible the Syrians are called
Aramites, who were an obscure people subject to the Persians, and subdued by Alexander:
after whose death this Countrey, with Persia, and other adjacent Provinces fell to
the share of Seleucus Nicanor; who also wrested from the successors of Antigonus,
the lesser Asia. This Kingdome hath suffered many alterations, especially by the Persians,
Grecians, Armenians, Romanes, Ægyptians, lastly, by the Turkes, and dayly molested
by the incursive Arabs.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182">182</a>]</span>
</p>
<p>In my expectation here, and the Spring come, (being disappointed of my desired aimes)
I pretended to visite Jerusalem in my backe-comming; and for the furtherance of my
determination, I joyned with a Caravan of Armenians, and Turkes, that were well guarded
with Janisaries, and Souldiers; of whom some were to stay at Damascus by the way,
and some mindfull to the furthest marke. And for my better safegard (being alwaies
alone which by all, was ever much admired) the Venetian Consull tooke surety of the
Captaine, that he should protect me safely from theeves, cut-throates, and the exactions
of <span class="right-marginnote">[V. 204.]</span>tributes by the way, delivering me freely into the hands of the Padre Guardiano at
Jerusalem: Which being done, I hired a Mule from a Turke, to carry my victuals; and
so set forward with them. The number of our company <span class="marginnote"><i>A Caravan of Armenians.</i></span>were about 900. Armenians, Christian Pilgrimes, men and women: 600. Turkes trafficking
for their owne businesse, and 100. souldiers, three Showsses, and sixe Janizaries,
to keepe them from invasions.
</p>
<p>Betweene Aleppo and Damascus, we had nine dayes journey, in five of which, we had
pleasant travelling, and good Canes to lodge in, that had beene builded for the support
of Travellers, and are well maintained: But when we passed Hamsek, which is a little
more then midway, we had dangerous travelling, being oft assailed with Arabs, fatigated
with rocky mountaines, and sometimes in point of choaking for lacke of water. The
confusion of this multitude, was not onely grievous in regard of the extreame heate,
providing of victuals at poore Villages, and scarcity of water, to fill our bottles,
made of Boare-skinnes; but also amongst narrow and stony passages, thronging, we oft
fell one over another, in great heapes; in danger to be smothered: yea; and oftentimes
we that were Christians, had our bodies well beaten, by our conducting Turkes. In
this journeying I remember the Turke who ought my Mule, was for three dayes exceeding
favourable unto me, in so much, that I began to doubt of his carriage, fearefully
suspecting the Italian Proverbe.

<p class="first"><span class="right-marginnote">[V. 205.]</span>But when I perceived, his extraordinary service and <span class="marginnote"><i>Pagan flattery.</i></span>flattery, was onely to have a share of the Tobacco I carried with me, I freely bestowed
a pound thereof upon him: Which he and his fellowes tooke as kindly, as though it
had beene a pound of gold, for they are excessively adictted to smoake, as Dutch men
are to the Pot: which ever made me to carry Tobacco with me, to acquist their favour,
over and above their fials, more then ever I did for my owne use: for in these dayes
I tooke none at all, though now as time altereth every thing, I am (Honoris Gratia)
become a courtly Tobacconist; more for fashion then for liking: The Turkish Tobacco
pipes are more than a yard long and commonly of Wood or Canes, beeing joynd in three
parts, with Lead or white Iron; their severall mouths receaving at once, a whole ounce
of Tobacco; which lasteth a long space, and because of the long pipes, the smoake
is exceeding cold in their swallowing throates.
</p>
<p>At our accustomed dismounting to recreate our selves, and refresh the beasts, I would
often fetch a walke, to stretch my legs, that were stifled with a stumbling beast;
wherewith the Turkes were mightily discontented, and in derision would laugh, and
mocke me: For they cannot abide a man to walke in turnes, or stand to eate; their
usage being such, that when they come from the horse backe, presently sit downe on
the ground, folding their feete under them, when they repose, dine, and suppe. So
doe also their Artizans and all the Turkes in the World sit allwayes crosse legged,
wrongfully abusing the commendable consuetude of the industrious Tailors. In their
houses they have no bed to lye on, nor chaire to sit on, nor table to eate on, but
a bench made of boords along the house side, of a foot high from the floore, spred
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184">184</a>]</span><span class="right-marginnote">[V. 206.]</span>over with a Carpet; whereon they usually sit eating, drinking, sleeping, resting,
and doing of manuall exercises, all in one place. Neither will the best sort of Mahometans
be named Turkes, because it signifieth banished in the Hebrew tongue, and therefore
they call <span class="marginnote"><i>Turkes are called Musilmans.</i></span>themselves Musilmans, to wit, good beleevers: where in deed for good, it is a false
Epithite, but certainely for firme beleevers they are wonderfull constant; and so
are all ignorants of whatsoever profession: even like to the Spaniard, who in the
midst of all his evills, yet he remaineth alwaies fidele to all the usurpations, the
Hispanicall Crowne can compasse.
</p>
<p>They never unclothe themselves when they goe to rest, neither have they any bed-clothes,
save onely a coverlet above them: I have seene hundreds of them after this manner,
lie ranked like durty swine, in a beastly stie, or loathsome Jades in a filthy stable.
</p>
<p>Upon the ninth day (leaving Cotafa behind us on the mountaines) we entred in a pleasant
Plaine of three leagues of length, adorned with many Villages, Gardens, and Rivers;
and arriving at Damascus, we were all lodged (some in Chambers wanting beds, and others
without, on hard stones) in a great Cane called Heramnen, where we stayed three dayes.
Having all which time given us twice a day provision for our selves and provender
for our beasts gratis; being allowed by the Grand Signior to all kind of strangers
whatsoever; that come to Damascus with any Caravan; being a singular comfort and advantage
to weary and extorted Travellers.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Damascus is called Shamma.</i></span>Damascus is the Capitall Citie of Syria, called by Turkes, Shamma, and is situated
on a faire Plaine, and beautified with many Rivers on each side, (especially Paraphar
and Abdenah) excellent Orchards, and all other <span class="right-marginnote">[V. 207.]</span>naturall objects of elegancy: That for situation, Artizens, all manner of commodities,
and varietie of fruits, in all the Asiaticall Provinces it is not paralelled. By Turkes
it is called, the Garden of Turkie, or rather their earthly Paradice, because of a
fenced Garden there, where a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185">185</a>]</span>Garison of Turkes lie continually keeping that tree Mouslee, whereon as they alledge
the forbidden Aple grew, wherewith the Serpent deceived Eve, and shee Adam, and from
whence the great Turke is also styled, keeper of the terrestriall Paradice.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The antiquitie of Damascus.</i></span>Some hold this Citie was built by Eleazer the servant of Abraham; and other say it
is the place where Caine slew Abel, where indeed it is most likely to be so: for hard
by Damascus I saw a pillar of Brasse erected there for a commemoration of that unnaturall
murther of Cain executed upon his innocent brother. But howsoever I perswade thee,
it is a pleasant and gallant Citie, well walled, and fortified with a strong Castle,
wherein the Bassaw remaineth: the most part of the streets are covered, so that the
Citizens are preserved in Summer from the heat, and in Winter from the raine.
</p>
<p>The like commoditie (but not after that forme) hath Padua in Lombardy: Their Bazar,
or Market place is also covered, so are commonly all the Bazars or Bezestans in Turky:
The best Carobiers, Adams Apples, and Grenadiers that grow on the earth is here: neare
unto the Bazar there is a Moskie called Gemmah, wherein my Guide shewed me the Sepulcher
of Ananias, and the Fountaine where he baptized Paul: In another street, I saw the
house of Ananias, which is but a hollow Celler under the ground, and where the Disciples
let Paul downe through the wall in a basket: In the street where they fell their Viæno,
my Interpreter shewed me a great gate of fine <span class="right-marginnote">[V. 208.]</span>mettall, which he sayd was one of the doores of the Temple of Salomon, and was transported
thence, by the Tartarians, who conquered Jerusalem about three hundred and eighty
yeares agoe, who for the heavy weight thereof, were enforced to leave it here, being
indeede a relicke of wonderfull bignesse: And I saw also such aboundance of Rose-water
here in barrels, to be sold, as beere or wine is rife with us.
</p>
<p>This Paradisiat Shamma, is the mother City, and most beautiful place of all Asia,
resembling every way (the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186">186</a>]</span>tectures of her Houses excepted being platforme) that matchlesse patterne and mirrour
of beauty, the City of Antwerp. The onely best Shables, or short crooked swords, that
be in the world are made here; and so are all other their weapons, as halfe Pikes,
Bowes, and Arrowes, and Baluckoes of steele, that Horse-men carry in their hands:
their shafts being three foot long, their heads great and round, and sharply guttered;
wherewith they use to braine or knocke downe their enemies in the field. <span class="marginnote"><i>The forces of the Bassa of Damascus.</i></span>The Beglerbeg or Bassa of Damascus, is the greatest of commandement of all other Bassaes
in Asia: Having under his authority (as he is under his Emperour) twenty two Sanzacks,
and they conducting under all the aforesayd three, forty thousand Timariots or Horse-men,
besides two thousand Janizaries, which are the guard of the Bassa, and Garrison of
the Citty. His Beglerbership extendeth over the greater halfe of Syria, a part of
the two Arabiaes F&#x153;lix and Petrea, Phenicia, Galilee, Samaria, Palestina, Judea, Jerusalem,
Idumea, and al the Northerne parts of Arabia Desartuous, even to the frontiers of
Egipt.
</p>
<p>The meanes of the preservation of so great a state, is only by an induced confidence
upon the power, and force <span class="right-marginnote">[V. 209.]</span>of those Timariots who as well have their pay and locall grounds of compensation in
time of tranquillitie, as warres, to defend these Countries, from the incursions of
the wilde Arabs, which evermore annoy the Turkes, and also Strangers: and cannot possibly
be brought to a quiet, and well formed manner of living; but are continuall spoilers
of these parts of the Turkes Dominions. That mischiefe daily increaseth, rather then
any way diminisheth. They taking example from the beastly Turkes, adde by these patterns
more wickednesse, to the badnesse of their owne dispositions: <span class="marginnote"><i>Savage Arabian Robbers.</i></span>So that every one of these Savages, according to his power, dealeth with all men uncivilly
&amp; cruelly, even like a wildernesse full of wilde beasts, living all upon rapine and
robbery, wanting all sense of humanity, more then a shew of appearance: Whereby being
combind <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187">187</a>]</span>together, doe tyrannize over all, even from the red Sea to Babylon.
</p>
<p>Thus they in that violent humour, invading also these of Affricke, hath caused Grand
Cayro to be furnished with thirty thousand Timariots, which defend the frontiers of
Ægypt and Gozan: Leaving all the Turkes at Damascus (save onely our Janizaries and
Souldiers) within the space of two houres after our departure from thence travelling
in the way to Jerusalem; the whole Armenians fell downe on the ground, kissing it,
and making many sincere demonstrations of unwonted devotion. At the which I being
amazed, stood gazing, asking my Trench man, what newes? who replied, saying, it was
the place where S. Paul was converted, which they had (and all Christianes should
have) in great regard. The place was covered with an old Chappell, and,
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">More like some relict, of exstirpd decay,
</p>
<p class="line">Than for a monument, reard for the way.
</p>
<p class="line"><span class="right-marginnote">[V. 210.]</span>To blaze on Pauls conversion: yet it&#x2019;s true
</p>
<p class="line">The worke was done, even by the Christiane Jew,
</p>
<p class="line">Or Jacobine: a circumcised kind,
</p>
<p class="line">Who beare to franks, a most respective mind:</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Three dayes were we betwixt Damascus, and the East part of Galilie, which is the beginning
of Canaan: in two of which three, we encountred with marishes and quagmires, being
a great hinderance to us: This barren, and marish Countrey, is a part of Arabia Petrea,
comming in with a point betweene Galilee, and Syria, running along even to the South-west
skirt of Libanus, which indeed in that place, farre more than Jordan divideth the
true Syria from Canaan; this Petrean Countrey it selfe, devalling even downe to the
limits of Jacobs bridge, cutteth away the denomination of Syria, from this parcell
of ground, till you come Eastward to the more laborious Plaines.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>A dangerous way.</i></span>Through this passage, it is most undoubtedly a very theevish way; for as we travelled
in the night, there were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188">188</a>]</span>many of us forced to carry burning lights in our hands, and our souldiers had their
Harquebuzes ready to discharge: all to affray the blood-thirsty Arabians, who in holes,
caves, and bushes, lie obscured, waiting for the advantage upon Travellers: not unlike
unto the Lawlesse Wood Carnes in Ireland. This part of Arabia is called Petrosa, because
it is so rockie, and some thinke of Petra the chiefe Towne: It was aunciently divided
in two regions Nabathia, and Agara, possessed first by the Hagarens, discended of
Abraham and Hagar: It is also thought to be the land of the Midianites whether Moses
fled to, and kept sheepe; and Mount Horeb is here, whereon the Lord did shew him the
land of Promise.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[V. 211.]</span>Divers of these Petrean Arabs, converse, and dwell amongst the Turkes; whom we tearme
in respect of the other, civill Arabs. South from hence, lieth Arabia Fælix bordering
with the Indian Sea; which is the most fruitfull and pleasant soyle in all Asia; abounding
with Balsamo, Myrrhe, and Frankincense, Gold and Pearles, especially about Medina,
the second Citie to Meccha: The other Townes of note are Horan, the chiefe Port of
the South Ocean, And Alteroch, the only Towne where Christians are in greatest number
in that Countrey.
</p>
<p>Truely with much difficulty, and greater danger passed we these <span class="marginnote"><i>Arabia Petrea.</i></span>Petrean journeys. Here I remarked a singular qualitie, and rare perfection, in the
carefull conduction of our Captaine; who would, when we came to any dangerous place,
give the watch-word of St. Johanne, meaning as much thereby, that none should speake
or whisper after that warning under the paine of a Harquebusado. And no more we durst,
unlesse he had stretcht out his hand, making us a signe (when occasion served) of
liberty, least by our tumultuous noyse in the night, our enemies should have the fore-knowledge
of our comming; and knowing also that the nature of a multitude, bred all times confused
effects, without some severe punishment. Him selfe rod stil in the Vangard, upon a
lusty Gelding, with two Janizaries, and forty Souldiers, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189">189</a>]</span>and the other foure Janizaries and sixty Souldiers, were appointed to be the backe-gard,
for feare of sudden assaults. Thus, most dexteriously discharged he the function of
his calling, not with insolencie, but with prudent and magnanimous virilitie: for
my part, I must needs say, the diligent care of that benigne Caravan extended over
me, was such, that whensoever I remember it, I am not able to sacrifice congratulations
sufficiently <span class="right-marginnote">[V. 212.]</span>to his well-deserving mind: yet in the meane while, my Purse bountifully rewarded
his earnest endevours; and notwithstanding, of this high conceived regard, yet in
some frivolous things, and for a small trifle, he privately wronged me, which I misknew,
as unwilling (knowing his disposition, and that my life hung in his hands) to be too
forward to seeke a redresse. For oftentimes an <span class="marginnote"><i>A corrupted Caravan.</i></span>inconvenience is most convenient; and as the great corrupter of youth is pleasure,
and the violent enemy of age is griefe; even so are the inordinate desires of inconscionable
strangers toward Travellers, who preferring avarice above honesty, care onely for
that part of a man which is his fortune, whose friendship beginning onely in an outward
show, must end in the midst of a mans money; as who would say, such like were rather
imployed, as their imployments rewarded, and therefore in unlawfull things they must
sucke the honey of their owne preposterous ends: And thus it fared with him, at the
paying of my tributes, by the way for my head, he caused me oft to pay, more then
reason, to the Moores, Turkes, and civill Arabs, receiving secretly backe from them
the over-plus; which my Turkish Servant perceiving, made my Trenchman tell me, that
I might be fore-seene therein.
</p>
<p>But such is the covetous nature of man, that with his covenant he cannot be contented,
unlesse he seeke otherwise, by all unlawfull meanes to purchase himselfe an unjust
gaine: But the high respect I had of his other perfections, made me oversee and winke
at that imperfection of avaritiousnesse in him; and especially remembring my selfe
to be under his protection, I alwayes endeavoured <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190">190</a>]</span>my aimes so, that in his sight, I wonne extraordinary <span class="right-marginnote">[V. 213.]</span>favour: insomuch, that in danger, or securitie, he would ever have me neere by him,
which I also craved, and strove to observe the points of his will, and my owne safety.
</p>
<p>The obligation of my bounden duety, taught me to no other end, then ever to respect
the benevolence of his affection, and to suppresse my owne weake judgement, which
could never mount to the true acquittance of his condigne merit.
</p>
<p>But to proceed in my Pilgrimage, on the aforesaid third day, in the after-noone, we
entred in Galilee, passing along a faire Bridge, that is over the River Jordan, which
divideth a part of this stony Arabia from Galilee. <span class="marginnote"><i>Jacobs Bridge.</i></span>This Bridge by the Armenians, is called Jacobs Bridge; and not farre hence, they shewed
me the place, where Jacob wrestled with the Angell, and where Esau met his brother
Jacob, to have killed him being upon the East side of the River: Jordan is scarcely
knowne by the name in this place: but afterward I saw his greater growth, ending in
Sodome, whereof in the owne place, I shall more amply discourse: Betweene Jacobs Bridge
and Jerusalem, we had sixe dayes journey, five whereof were more pleasant than profitable,
in regard of the great tributs I payd by the way for my head, that at sundry places
and into one day, I have payd for my freedome in passage twelve Chickens of gold,
amounting to five pounds eight shillings of English money: A journall tribute more
fit for a Prince to pay, than a Pilgrime; the admiration onely resting upon this,
how I was furnished with these great moneyes I dayly disbursed.
</p>
<p>Aprill the eighteene day, according to the computation of the Romane Calender, and
by ours, March the eight and twenty, I entred in Galilee, a Province of Canaan; This
<span class="right-marginnote">[V. 214.]</span>Countrey was first called Canaan from Canan the sonne of Cham: secondly the Land of
Promise, because it was promised By the Lord to Abraham and his seed to possesse:
Thirdly, the land of Israel, of the Israelites, so called from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191">191</a>]</span>Jacob, who was surnamed Israel: Fourthly, Judea, from the Jewes, or the people of
the tribe of Judah: Fifthly, Palestine quasi Philistim, the land of the Philistins.
And now sixtly, terra sancta, the holy land, because herein was wrought many wonderfull
miracles, but especially the worke of our salvation. It is in length 180. and in breadth
60. miles: yet of that salubrity of aire and fertility of soyle, flowing with milke
and hony, that before the comming of the Israelites it maintayned thirty Kings, with
their people, and afterward the two potent Kingdomes of Israel and Judah; in which
David numbred one million and 300000. fighting men, besides them of the tribe of Benjamin
and Levi: It is most certayne, that by the goodnesse of the Climate and soile, especially
by the <span class="marginnote"><i>Canaan greatly changed.</i></span>blessing of God, it was the most fruitfull Land in the World: but by experience, I
find now the contrary, and the fruitfulnes thereof to be changed, God cursing the
Land together with the Jewes, then the (but now dispersed) inhabitants thereof. Neither
are the greatest part of these Easterne countries so fertile, as they have beene in
former ages, the earth as it were growing olde, seemeth weary to beare the burthen
of any more encrease; and surely the two eyes of Day and Night, with the Planets,
and Starres, are become neyther so forcible, so bright, nor warme as they have beene:
Time from olde antiquity, running all things to devasted desolation, making the strong
things weake, and weake things feeble, at last it returneth all things to just nothing:
and there is the end of all beginnings, and an infallible Argument of the dissolution
to come by the day of judgement.<span class="right-marginnote">[V. 215.]</span>
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">As things that are, still vanish from our eye,
</p>
<p class="line">So things that were, againe shall never be:

</div>
<p class="first">The Jewes are also tearmed Hebrai, or Hebrewes from Heber one of Abrahams Progenitors,
or Hebræ quasi <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192">192</a>]</span>Abrahæi: who at their discent into Egypt, were but seventy soules being the issue
of Jacob, and his twelve Sonnes. The posterity of which Patriarchy, continued in bondage
two hundred and fifteene yeares, till in the yeare of the world, two thousand foure
hundred fifty three: At which time, the Lord commiserating their heavy oppressions
under the Egyptians, delivered them with a strong hand, and placed them here: which
then was inhabited by the Hittites, Amorites, Perisits, and Jebusits. <span class="marginnote"><i>The Holy Land.</i></span>Canaan is divided into five Provinces, viz. Judea, Galilee, Palestina, Samaria, and
Phenicia: Some divide it only in three, Palestina, Judea, and Galilee: It hath beene
by others also nominated in generall, Syria, by which Calculation, they gathered all
the Countries from Cilicia to Egypt under that name. But howsoever they differ in
Descriptions, it is most certayne, that at this day, it is onely, and usually divided
into these five particular Provinces: Galilee, and Palestina, for the present, are
the most fertile and largest Provinces thereof, especially Galilee, which in some
parts, yeeldeth graine twice a yeare, and for abundance of Silke, Cotton-woole, delicate
Wines, Hony, Oyle, and fruites of all kindes; I hold it never a whit more decayed
now, than at any time when the glory of Israel was at the highest: This province of
Galilee is forty eight miles long, and twenty five broad, having Phenicia to the North:
Samaria to the west: <span class="right-marginnote">[V. 216.]</span>Jordan to the South: and to the East and North-East, a part or poynt of Arabia-Petrosa,
and the South-west end of Libanus.
</p>
<p>After we had travailed a great way, along the Lake of Genasareth, which is of length
eight leagues, and large foure: where I saw the decayed Townes of Bethsaida, and Tyberias,
lying on the North-side of the same Sea, we left the Marine, and came to Cana, to
stay all night: in which wee had no Canes to save us from the Arabs, nor coverture
above our heads, but the hard ground to lye on, which was alwayes my Bed, in the most
parts of Asia: In the night, when we slept, the Souldiers kept <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193">193</a>]</span>Centinell, and in the day, when we Reposed, they slept, and we watched.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Cana in Galilee.</i></span>This Cana was the towne wherein our Saviour wrought the first Miracle, converting
at the Marriage, Water into Wine: And is now called by the Turkes Callieros or Calinos,
being a towne composed of two hundred fire Houses: The inhabitants beeing partly Arabs,
partly Jewes, and partly some Christian Georgians: the circumjacent fieldes, beeing
both Fertile, Delectable, and plaine.
</p>
<p>The day following, imbracing our way, wee passed over a little pleasant Mountayne,
where the Armenian Patriarke (for so was there one with them) went into an old Chappell,
and all the rest of the Pilgrimes thronged about him, using many strange Ceremonies,
for it was in that place (as they sayd) Where Christ fed five thousand people, with
five Barley loaves, and two fishes. And indeede was very likely to have beene the
place: the auncient Chappell, showing as yet some beautiful decorements, do dignifie
both the Monument, and the Memory of the Founder thereof.
</p>
<p>Continuing our journey, wee saw Mount Tabor on our <span class="right-marginnote">[V. 217.]</span>left hand, which is a pretty round Mountaine, beset about with comely trees: I would
gladly have seene the Monument of that place, where the Transfiguration of Christ
was: But the Caravan, mindfull to visite Nazareth, left the great way of Jerusalem,
and would by no perswasion go thither.
</p>
<p>That night we lodged in a poore Village, called Heerschek, where we could get neither
meate for our selves, nor provender for the Beasts, but some of our Company for their
supper, had a hundred stroakes from the Moores and Arabs in that place, because the
Christian Pilgrimes had troden upon the graves of their dead friends, which by no
meanes they can tollerate: They made no small uproare amongst us, desperately throwing
stones and darts, till we were all glad to remove halfe a mile from that place; and
the next morning we passed by <span class="marginnote"><i>Cæsarea Philippi.</i></span>Cæsarea Philippi which is now so miserably decayed, that the ruined <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194">194</a>]</span>Towne affordeth not above twenty foure dwelling houses, being for ruines, a second
Towne, to sacked Samaria, or another spectacle of time like to the now ragged Towne
of the Moorish Bethulia: It was built by Philip one of the <span class="corr" id="xd29e4898" title="Source: Tetrachs">Tetrarchs</span> in honour of Tiberius Cæsar, and now called by the Moores Hedarasco. Here was Herod
smitten by the Angels, and eaten of wormes, after the Sycophanticall people called
his Rethoricall oration, the voyce of God, and not of man: Here our Saviour healed
the woman of the bloody fluxe, and raised from death to life the daughter of Jairus:
Here S. Peter baptized Cornelius, and S. Paul disputed against Tertullius in the presence
of Felix.
</p>
<p>Aprill the 20. day, about ten of the clocke, (passing the River Kyson) we arrived
at Nazareth, and there reposed till the evening, providing our selves of victuals
<span class="right-marginnote">[V. 218.]</span>and water: In this Towne dwelt Joseph, and the Virgin Mary; and in which also our
Saviour was brought up under the vigilant care of Joseph and Mary. After wee had dined,
the Armenians arose, and went to a heape of stones, the ruines of an old house, before
the which they fell downe upon their knees; praysing God: And that ruinous lumpe (say
they) was the house where Mary dwelt, when Gabriel saluted her, bringing the Annunciation
of Salvation to the World: I am fully perswaded, they carried away above five thousand
pounds weight, to keepe in a <span class="marginnote"><i>A counter buffet for Loretta.</i></span>memoriall thereof: then did I remember of the Chappell of Loretta, and told the Caravan,
that I saw that house standing in Italy, which (as the Romanists say) was transported
by the Angels: O, said he, we Armenians cannot beleeve that, neither many other assertions
of the Roman Church; for we certainely know by Christians, that have from time to
time dwelt here ever since, that this is both the place, and stones of the house:
Let Papists coyne a new Law to themselves, we care not, for as they erre in this,
so doe they erre in all, following meerely the traditions of men, they runne galloping
post to Hell. The Patriarke being informed by the laughing Caravan of these newes,
asked me in disdaine (thinking it had beene an Article <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195">195</a>]</span>of my beliefe) if I saw that house, or beleeved that the Chappell of Loretta was such
a thing: to whom I constantly answered, I did not beleeve it, affirming it was onely
but a divellish invention, to deceive the blind-folded people, and to fill the Coffers
of the Romane Priests: Now thou bottomlesse Gulfe of Papistry, here I forsake thee,
no Winter-blasting Furies of Satans subtile stormes, can make ship-wracke of my Faith,
on the stony shelfes of thy deceitfull deepes.
</p>
<p>Thus, and after this manner too: are all the illusions <span class="right-marginnote">[V. 219.]</span>of their imaginary and false miracles, first invented partly by monasteriall poverty,
then confirmed by provincial bribery, and lastly they are faith-sold for consistoricall
lucre. In the time of our staying here<span class="corr" id="xd29e4920" title="Source: ;">,</span> the Emeere or Lord of the Towne sent sixe women, conducted by 12. of his servants,
to an Armenian Prince, that was a Pilgrime in our company; to be used by him and others,
<span class="marginnote"><i>Libidinous leachery.</i></span>whom so he would elect to be his fellow labourers: Which indeed he did kindly accept,
&amp; invited me to that feast: but I gave him the refusall, little regarding such a frivolous
commodity. He, and some of the chiefest Pilgrimes entertained them for the space of
3. houres, and sent them backe, giving to their conductors fifteene Piasters, in a
reward. Truely if I would rehearse the impudency of these Whoores, and the bruitishnesse
of the Armenians, as it is most ignominious to the actors; so no doubt, it would be
very loathsome to the Reader.
</p>
<p>Such is the villanie of these Orientall slaves under the Turkes; that not onely by
conversing with them, learne some of their damnable Hethnicke customes, but also going
beyond them in beastly sensualnesse, become worse then bruite beasts: This maketh
me remember a worthy saying of that Heathnish Romane Emperour Marcus Aurelius, who
in consideration of fleshly lusts, said; that although he were sure, that the Gods
would not punish him for the offence; yet he would forbeare it, in regard of the filthinesse
of the fact it selfe: Indeed of a Pagane a noble and vertuous resolution, when such
base and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196">196</a>]</span>beastly Christianes, these wretched Armenians, committed with these Infidelish harlots
a twofold kind of voluptuous abhomination, which my conscience commands me to conceale:
least I frequent this Northern world, with that which their nature never knew, nor
their knowledge have <span class="right-marginnote">[V. 220.]</span>heard hearing of the like: but God in his just judgements, that same night, threatned
both to have punished the doers, and the whole company for their sakes: For we having
resolved to travell all that night, and because the way was rocky, and hard to be
knowne, and perillous for Arabs; we hired a Christian guide, named Joab, and agreed
with him to take us to Lidda, which was two dayes journey. But before we advanced
to our passage, Joab had sent a privie messenger before us, to warne about three hundred
Arabs (who had their abode on the South side <span class="marginnote"><i>A villanous plot.</i></span>of Mount Carmell) to meete him at such a place as he had appointed; giving them to
know, wee were rich and well provided with Chickens and Sultans of gold, and Piasters
of silver; and that he should render us into their hands for such a recompense and
consideration, as their savage judgements should thinke fit; according to the spoyles
and booties they should obtaine, together with the miserable murder and losse of our
lives. This being done, and unknowne to us, we marched along, travelling faster then
our ordinary pace, some on horse, and some on foote, for my pilgrimage was ever pedestriall:
which our guide suspecting, that by our celerity wee should goe beyond the place appointed
for his treacherous plot, began to crosse us grievously; leading us up and downe amongst
pooles and holes, whither he listed; where many of our Camels &amp; Asses were lost, and
could not be recovered, because we all began to suspect and feare; which was the cause
that the owners durst not stay to relieve their perishing beasts.
</p>
<p>In the end, the Captaine and Janisaries, intreated him earnestly to bring us in the
right way; but the more they requested, the more obdurat was his heart, replying,
he was mistaken, and could not finde it, till day light: upon <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href="#pb197">197</a>]</span><span class="right-marginnote">[V. 221.]</span>the which words, the company was stayed, and in the meanewhile there came a Turke,
one of our Souldiers unto the Captaine, saying; he saw the guide, before our <span class="marginnote"><i>A treacherous guide.</i></span>departure from Nazareth, send a Moore before him, for what respect he knew not, being
long at privat conference. Whereupon, they straight bound him with ropes, on a horse
backe, threatning him with death, to cause him confesse the trueth.
</p>
<p>In the midst of this tumult, I having got sight of the North-starre, (which seemd
exceeding low to me) considered thereby, that the villaine had led us more to the
Southward, then to the Westward, which was our way to Jerusalem: Whereupon I intreated
the Caravan to turne our faces Northward, otherwise we should be cut off, and that
suddenly: for although (said I) it may peradventure be, that we are three or foure
miles short of the place intended for our massacre, yet they missing us, will like
ravening Wolves hunt here and there; wherefore, if we incline to the North, (God willing)
we shall prevent their bloody designes. To the which advice (being duely pondered)
they yeelded; and so I became their guide, in that darke night, till morning: for
none of them knew that Starre, neither the nature of it. At last this desperate wretch
considering that either by our vanquishing, or the enemies victory, he could not escape,
sith his treason was revealed; began to beg pardon of the Caravan, saying that if
he could have any surety of his life, he would sufficiently informe us, how to eschew
these eminent dangers, for we were all in extreame perill of our lives; and not so
much courage nor comfort left us, as the very smallest hope of any reliefe.
</p>
<p>The Captaine being distracted with feare, replied he would, and thereupon swore a
solemne oath, so did the <span class="right-marginnote">[V. 222.]</span>Janisaries sweare by the head of Mahomet, for the like effect: Which being done, he
was untied, and confessed, that if we had continued in our way, he led us, wee had
beene all put to the edge of the Sword: and falling down on his knees, cried oft with
teares, mercy, mercy, mercy.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198">198</a>]</span>
</p>
<p>All that night we went with the Starre, and against morning wee were in the Westerne
confines of Ph&#x153;nicia, and at the beginning of Palestine, close by the marine, and
within halfe a mile of Tyrus. This sometimes renowned <span class="marginnote"><i>Tyrus is called Sur.</i></span>Citty of Tyrus, called now by the Moores Sur, was famous for her Purples, and Collonies
dispersed over all the World by her Citizens; and once a kingdome of great antiquity
and long continuance. The most worthiest of her Kings, were Hiram in strict bond of
Confederacy, with Salomon, and Pigmalion the brother of Dido, who built Carthage:
This seat, giving way to the Persian Monarchy, was about the overthrow of Darius,
beleagured by Alexander: who had so much adoe with extraordinary expence of men, money,
and great labour to conquer it, being then separated from the maine Continent, by
the Sea, but now joyned to the firme Land: and before you come to the Citty, there
lyeth a great banke of sand, where it is likely the Sea hath beene in Alexanders time:
Though now, as time altereth every thing, the Sea be fled from that place, which maketh
that ruinous Towne seeme more desolate. At the breach of day, I, and certaine Armenians
went to visite this decayed Towne, and found the most famous ruines here, that the
World for memory can affoord, and a Delicious incircling Harbour, inclos&#x2019;d within
the middle of the Towne, fit to receive smal Barkes, Frigots, and Galleots: the compassing
fore-face whereof, beeing all of foure squard Marble and Alabaster stones: the most
part of all which <span class="right-marginnote">[V. 223.]</span>Houses have stood on pillars of the same stones: the <span class="marginnote"><i>The ruines of Tyrus.</i></span>infinite number whereof, may as yet bee, (above and below the Sands) perspectively
beheld. There be onely some nineteene fire houses heere, which are Moores: and is
now under the Emeere of the Drusians, who remayneth in Sydon. The East part of this
Countrey aboundeth in Balme, Honny, and Oyle, and was the Seate of Asher of whom Moses
prophecied, Deut. 33. 24. that hee should dippe his feete in Oyle.
</p>
<p>Here these Egyptian Moores, for so they were first <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199">199</a>]</span>bred there: brought us to a pillar lying upon the ground, of nine severall colours
of Marble, being one intire stone, and the length of it was twenty two foot of my
measure, and eight in compasse: Which sayd they, was one of the <span class="marginnote"><i>Sampsons Pillar.</i></span>pillars that Sampson pulled downe upon the Philistines at the houre of his Death.
To whom I answered, that Sampson dyed at Azath, the furthest South-west part of Palestine,
where hee bore downe the House of Dagon, upon the Philistines: And I thinke the auncient
Tyrians, sayd I, could not transport that Pillar so far hither: But they the more
constantly affirmed it, and so did these Armenians that were with mee confirme it
also, some of whom, had beene twice there before: yet howsoever it was, I brought
home a pound weight of it, and presented the halfe thereof, to King James of blessed
Memory.
</p>
<p>Here by accident, in returning backe to the Caravan, I met with an English Factor,
named Maister Brockesse, who then remayned at Sydon, eighteene miles from this place,
and had been downe at Acre, about some negotiations: Who indeede eftsoones, and kindly
tooke mee into a Moorish House by the Sea side, and one of his acquaintance: where
instantly we swallowed downe such joviall and deep carrouses of Leaticke wine, that
both hee and I, were almost fastned in the last plunge of <span class="right-marginnote">[V. 224.]</span>understanding: Yet neverthelesse, he conveyed me backe to my company, and put me safe
into the hands of the Caravan, with whom afterwards I diverse times met with here
at London; to whose kindnesse I celebrate the memory of these lines.
</p>
<p>But now the Sunne discovering the earth, and the night banished to the inferiour world,
we were all encouraged, for the light of day lends comfort: The Captaine (sending
backe that false Judas, for so was he sworne to do) sent a post to Tyrus for a new
guide, who came forthwith, and brought us in our way to Mount Carmell, for by it we
<span class="marginnote"><i>The Towne of Sarepta.</i></span>behoved to go; and in our way we met with the desolate Towne of Sarepta nigh thereunto
adjoyning, where Elias <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200">200</a>]</span>was sustained in a great famine by a Widdow, whose sonne he raised from death.
</p>
<p>Great are the mercies of God, for as he hath made man an excellent creature, so hath
he also indued him with two great powers in his mind: The one a wise power of understanding,
by which he penetrateth into the knowledge of things: the other a strong power of
dexterous resolving; whereby he executeth things well understood, for we having judged
the worst, resolved the best: and by his Almighty providence were freed from that
apparent danger, although the former dayes whoredome, and unnaturall vices, deserved
a just punishment.
</p>
<p>This I intimate to all Travellers in generall, that if they would that God should
further them in their attempts, blesse their voyages, and graunt them a safe returne
to their native Countries (without the which, what contentment have they for all their
paines) that they would constantly refraine from whoredome, drunkennesse, and too
much familiarity with Strangers: For a Traveller <span class="right-marginnote">[V. 225.]</span>that is not temperate, and circumspect in all his actions, although he were headed
like that Herculean Serpent Hydra, yet it is impossible he can returne in safety from
danger of Turkes, Arabs, Moores, wild beasts, &amp; the deadly operative extremities of
heat, hunger, thirst, and cold.
</p>
<p>Approaching to Mount Carmell, and leaving it upon our right hand betweene us and the
marine coast, I beheld a farre off upon the top of the hill, the place where Elias
ascended to heaven, when he left his Cloake behind him to Elizeus his disciple. This
mountaine is foure miles of length, lying South and North, the North end bordering
with the Sea, neare to Acre, called anciently Ptolomæis, and the South end joyning
with the borders of Samaria, through the which confine we past.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Samaria.</i></span>Leaving Samaria on our left hand, we entred into a faire Plaine, adorned with fruitfull
trees, and all other ornaments that pleasant fields affoord, but no Village wee saw.
Marching thus about the declining of the Sunne <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201">201</a>]</span>from the Meridian, we came in sight of two hundred pavillions, all pitched in rankes;
yeelding the prospect of a little Citie, by a brooke side of water: which being perceived,
the Captaine began to censure what they might be; and immediately there came riding
towards us, sixe naked fellowes, well mounted on Arabian Geldings, who demanded what
wee were? and whither we were bound with such a multitude; and if there were any Franks
of Christendome in our company. To whom the Janisaries replied, we were purposed to
Jerusalem, and that there was but one Franke with them: Upon the which they presently
sought me, demanding Caffar, Caffar; that was tribute for my head, &amp; caused me perforce
notwithstanding of the resisting Caravan, and Janizaries, to pay them presently for
my life seven Chickens of gold, seven times <span class="right-marginnote">[V. 226.]</span>nine shillings starling: And this is, because sayd they our King is resident in these
Tents, and therefore we have tripled his tribute: And yet were they discontented,
because there were no moe franks in our company, for from the Armenians, they could
not, nor would not seeke any tribute, because they were tributary slaves and subjects
to the great Turke: neither also of any other Christiane borne in his dominions, when
they shall happen to fall into their hands.
</p>
<p>They returning backe to their Prince, with the malediction of my heart, and the sorrow
of a Pilgrimes purse, we marching on in our way, that day wee travelled above thirty
foure miles, and pitched at a Village called Adoash, being composed of threescore
Moorish and Arabian houses, standing in a fruitfull and delicate Plaine; and garnished
with Olive, Date, and Figge-trees, which were both pleasant and profitable: where
we found also good hearbes to eate, and abundance of water to drinke, and also to
fill our emptied bottles: As wee lay downe to sleepe after a hungry supper, on the
hard ground, and our guard watching us; <span class="marginnote"><i>The savage Arabian King.</i></span>that same King of the Arabians came a little before mid-night, with twenty foure well
horsed Runagats, and naked Courtiers, being armed with bowes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202">202</a>]</span>and arrowes, and halfe-pikes, pointed at both ends with hard Steele; and asked for
the Caravan, who presently awoke, and went to salute him, laying his hand on his breast,
bowed his head very low; which is the usuall courtesie amongst the Infidels and Christians
in these parts: For they never uncover their heads to any man; and after some short
parley, they sate all downe on the grasse. The Caravan presented his rude like majesty
with water, bread, hearbes, figs, garlike, and such things as he had.
</p>
<p>As they were thus merry, at this poore banquet, the <span class="right-marginnote">[V. 227.]</span>awfull King tooke the Oath of our Conductor, if there were any mo Frankes there then
I; and he having sworne the trueth, The King by a malignant informer, incontinently
caused me to be brought before him; and staring me in the face, asked my Interpreter
where were my companions? Who replied I had none: then sayd he; tell that dogge, or
Elishole, he must acknowledge me with five peeces of gold more, otherwise (making
a signe to his owne throate) I shall cut off his head, because (sayd he) I will not
loose this nights travell for nothing: The which I being informed, and knowing that
by no condition, there was resistance against such a scelerate Prince, <span class="marginnote"><i>Exaction of tribute.</i></span>gave it him forth of mine owne hand, having consulted with my Captaine before, and
that presently with a halfe smiling countenance; which he remarking, told the rest,
it seemed I gave it with a good heart &amp; a chearefull gesture, and to recompence my
outward behaviour, he drunke a great draught of water to me: thinking thereby, he
had done me more honour then all the Chickens of gold I gave him now, and in the morning;
would doe him profit or pleasure: pleasure they could doe him none, for they were
unlawfully and dishonestly got, and too delivered from the inward sorrow of my sighing
soule; and no wonder, having spent two yeares great charges in Turky, before this
time, but that I should have beene exceeding penurious of money, and thereupon desolate
of reliefe and comfort.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203">203</a>]</span>
</p>
<p>Truely this was one of the greatest tributes I payed for one dayes journey, that I
had in all my voyage, in Asia. <span class="marginnote"><i>Two Arabian Kings.</i></span>There are two Kings in Arabia, the one who liveth on Euphrates, the desarts of Mesopotamia,
sometimes <span class="right-marginnote">[V. 228.]</span>in Arabia Felix, and in some parts of Syria: And the other was hee to whom I payd
this money wandereth with his Tribes, Tents, and Bestiall, one while in Arabia Petrea,
and Deserta, and sometimes in the Holy Land, as hee findeth good pastorage, and fresh
Fountaynes. These two Kings are mortall enemies: and if by accident they meete, they
fight most cruelly, bringing dammage, rapine, and destruction to themselves, and their
followers: For it is a difficult thing in them to dominate their inordinate passions,
beeing untamed Savages, and mis-regarders of civility, who continually contend to
corroborate the malignity of their dispositions, with bloody and inhumane interprises.
And yet all the rest of that night, after his returne from us, wee still expected
some treacherous surprise, which made our souldiers stand stoutly on their guard,
and wee Pilgrimes to our vigilant and naked defence: For the Turkes will not suffer
Christians to carry weapons in al these Dominions, neither any where, where they command.
And for all this great tribute, and nights danger of my life, heere was my present
resolution:

his associats to beate me soundly, and dismount my Victuals and Water <span class="right-marginnote">[V. 229.]</span>from the Mules backe, till I propined him with the rest, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204">204</a>]</span>which intention being by me understood; I forthwith run to the Caravan and complained:

</p>
<p>Saturday morning before the breach of day, setting forward from Lydda, through the
curling playnes of fat-fac&#x2019;d Palestine, scarcely were wee well advanced in <span class="marginnote"><i>A dreadfull conflict.</i></span>our way, till wee were beset with more then three hundred Arabs, who sent us from
shrubby heights an unexpected shoure of Arrowes, to the great annoyance of all our
Company: For if it had not beene, that our Souldiers shot off their Gunnes on a sudden,
and stood manly also to it, with their Bowes and Arrowes for our defence, we had then
miserably, in the midst of their ravenous fury perished. But the nature of the Arabs
is not unlike to the Jackals: For when any of them heare the shot of a Harquebuse,
they presently turne backe with such speed, as if the fiendes of the infernall Court
were broken loose at their heeles.
</p>
<p>In that momentary conflict, on our side there were <span class="right-marginnote">[V. 232.]</span>killed nine Women, five men, and about thirty persons deadly wounded, which to our
worthy Armenian Captayne, and to the rest of our Heathnish Conductors bred no small
griefe: the mourning noyse among the multitude, beeing also wondrous pittifull. Till
bright day came, we stayed still in that same place, (expecting the dangerous mutability
of our austiere fortune: and at our departure thence, wee buried the slayne people
in deep graves, whereby Jackals should not open up their graves, to eate their Corpes:
For such is the nature of these cruel beasts, that they onely love to live on mans
flesh: these ravenous beasts (as is thought) are ingendred of a Foxe and a Wolfe.

<p>Proceeding in our journey, we entred about two of the clocke in the afternoone, in
the hilly Countrey of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207">207</a>]</span>Judea, having two of their courses to Jerusalem, which is about twenty English miles:
<span class="marginnote"><i>The Towne of Rhama.</i></span>leaving Rhama on our right hand, which contayneth some two hundred dwelling houses
of one story high, and ten miles distant from Joppa, from which it lyeth in the way
to Jerusalem: Here remayneth the Dragoman, a Christian, who receiveth and conveyeth
the Pilgrimes to Jerusalem, which land at Joppa, each Pilgrime paying seaven Chickens
of gold, is furnished with an Asse to ride on, all the way tributes, at going, and
comming being discharged by their Conductor, to whom they resigne this tributary money.
</p>
<p>Rhama is a Towne inhabited by Christians, Arabs, and Moores: not blacke Moores, as
the Affricans be, but they are called Mori, which are a kinde of Egyptians, and not
naturally blacke, but Sunne-burnt, with the parching heate. The whole Territory of
Canaan, is inhabited with these Moores, some Turkes, civill Arabs, and a few <span class="right-marginnote">[V. 233.]</span>Christians and scattered Jewes. The Arabians are for the most part Theeves and Robbers,
the Moores cruell, and uncivill, hating Christians to the Death: the Turkes are the
ill best of all the three, yet all sworne enemies to Christ. But when they know how
to make any gayne by strangers: O what a dissimulate ostentation shall appeare in
these detestable Villaines, whose outsides onely they seeme to affect: but intirely
the insides of their purses: &amp; that is their ayme, and forcible end: wherefore they
both toyle with all, and Conduct strangers through many perils, as eminent to themselves,
as accessary unto our inevitable destinies: Time discussing all, and mony over-mastering
time; for Coyne is the thing they must have, though necessity sometimes may not spare
it.
</p>
<p>About foure of the clocke before night, wee arrived at <span class="marginnote"><i>Beersheba.</i></span>Berah, called of olde Beersheba, being eleaven miles distant from Jerusalem. Having
a little reposed there, giving our Camels, Mules, and Asses some provender, but could
get nothing for our selves, from these despightfull Moores, (for what wee carried
with us, was all spent) except a little Water: wee imbraced our Mountaynous <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href="#pb208">208</a>]</span>way, as cheerefully as wee could, for wee were exceeding faint, and travailed that
day above forty three miles; whereby wee might arrive at Jerusalem before the Gates
were shut, sustaining great drouth, burning heate, pinching hunger, and not a few
other the like inconveniences.
</p>
<p>And now about halfe way betweene Berah and Jerusalem, I, and two Armenians, advancing
our way a flight shot before the Company. Wee I say, unhappily rancountred with foure
Moorish fellowes, driving before them sixe Asses loaden with Rootes, and shrubs of
Wood to burne: who seeing us, as they thought alone, layd <span class="right-marginnote">[V. 234.]</span>hands upon us, robbed us of our pocket monies: whereat <span class="marginnote"><i>A grievous danger.</i></span>I resisting, one of them pulled foorth a broad knife, and holding me by the Beard,
thought to have cut my throate, if it had not beene for one of his fellowes, who swiftly
stayed him.
</p>
<p>Well, they leave us, and following their Beasts, our Souldiers instantly appeared
unto us; whereupon wee shouting, the Moores fled to the Rocks, and our foot Souldiers
following, apprehended two of the chiefest, and brought them to the Captaine: One
of which had my money, which I presently received backe againe, but mine associates
money, was with them that escaped: the Captaine and Janisaries, meane while carried
the two Moores along with them, thinking to execute them at Jerusalem. But their friends
and neighbours following fast on Horse-backe, and on foote, relieved them from the
Caravan, restoring backe againe the two Armenians money. Whereat all the Moores were
exceeding glad, and wee nowayes discontented: for if they had not bin redeemed, certainly
their friends and followers, who were thicke flocking together, would have cut us
all off, before wee could have attain&#x2019;d to Jerusalem.
</p>
<p>At last wee beheld the prospect of Jerusalem, which was not onely a contentment to
my weary body, but also beeing ravished with a kinde of unwonted rejoycing, the <span class="marginnote"><i>A joyfull harmony.</i></span>teares gushed from my eyes for too much joy. In this time the Armenians began to sing
in their owne fashion, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209">209</a>]</span>Psalmes to praise the Lord: and I also sung the 103 Psalme all the way, till we arrived
neere the wals of the Citty, where wee ceased from our singing, for feare of the Turkes.
</p>
<p>The Sunne being passed to his nightly Repose, before our arrivall, wee found the Gates
locked, and the Keyes carried up to the Bashaw in the Castle; which bred a <span class="right-marginnote">[V. 235.]</span>common sorrow in the Company, being all both hungry, and weary: yet the Caravan intreated
earnestly the Turkes within, to give us over the Wals, some victuals for our money,
shewing heavily the necessity wee had thereof, but they would not, neyther durst attempt
such a thing. In this time the Guardian of the Monastery of Cordeleirs, who remayneth
there to receive Travailers of Christendome, who having got newes of our late arrivall,
came and demanded of the Caravan, if any Frankes of Europe were in his Society, and
he sayd, onely one. Then the Guardian called mee, and asked of what Nation I was of,
and when I told him, hee seemed to be exceeding glad: yet very sorrowfull for our
misfortune.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>A deare nights Supper.</i></span>Hee having knowne my distresse, returned, and sent two Friers to me with Bread, Wine,
and Fishes, which they let over the Wall (as they thought in a secret place) but they
were espied, and on the morrow the Guardiano payed to the Subbashaw or Sanzacke a
great fine, being a hundred Piasters, thirty pounds sterling: otherwise both hee and
I had beene beheaded: which I confesse, was a deare bought supper to the Gray Frier;
and no lesse almost to me, being both in danger of my Life for starving, and then
for receiving of food, therefore suspected for a Traytor: For the Turkes alleadged,
he had taken in munition from me, and the other Christians, to betray the Citty: this
they doe oft, for a lesser faulte then that was, onely to get Bribes and mony from
the Grey Friers, which daily stand in feare of their lives.
</p>
<p>Anno 1612. upon Palme-Sunday in the morning, wee entred into Jerusalem, and at the
Gate wee were particularly searched, to the effect wee carried in no Furniture <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210">210</a>]</span><span class="right-marginnote">[V. 236.]</span>of Armes, nor Powder with us, and the poore Armenians (notwithstanding they are slaves
to Turkes,) behoved to render their weapons to the Keepers, such is the feare they
have of Christians. And my name was written up in the Clarkes Booke at the Port, that
my tribute for the Gate, and my seeing of the Sepulcher, might bee payed at one time
together, before my finall departure thence.
</p>
<p>The Gates of the City are of iron outwardly, and above each Gate are brazen Ordonance
planted, for their defence.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>A foolish ceremony.</i></span>Having taken my leave of the Caravan, and the Company, who went to lodge with their
owne Patriarke, I was met and received with the Guardian, and twelve Friers upon the
streetes, each of them carrying in their hands a burning waxe Candle, and one for
mee also: who received mee joyfully, and singing all the way to their Monastery Te
Deum Laudamus, they mightily rejoyced, that a Christian had come from such a far Countrey
as Scotia, to visite Jerusalem.
</p>
<p>Where being arrived, they forthwith brought me to a Roome, and there the Guardian
washed my right foote with water, and his Viccar my left: and done, they kissed my
feete, so did also all the twelve Friers that stood by: But when they knew afterward
that I was no Popish Catholicke, it sore repented them of their Labour. I found here
ten Frankes newly come the neerest way from Venice hither, sixe of them were Germanes,
noble Gentlemen, and they also good Protestants, who were wonderfull glad to heare
me tell the Guardian flatly in his face, I was no Romane Catholicke, nor never thought
to be: The other foure Frankes were Frenchmen, two of them Parisians old men, the
other two of Provance, all foure <span class="right-marginnote">[V. 237.]</span>being Papists: with nine other Commercing Frankes, also that dwelt in Syria and Cyprus,
most of them beeing Venetians, who were all glad of me, shewing themselves so kinde,
so carefull, so loving, and so honourable in all respects, that they were as kind
Gentle-men, as ever I met withall, especially the Germaines: Such is the love of strangers,
when they meete in Forraine and remote <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211">211</a>]</span>places. They had also in high respect the adventures of my halfe yeares travaile,
East, and beyond Jerusalem: troubling me all the while wee were together, to show
them the rare Discourses of my long two yeares survey of Turkey, but especially of
my furthest sights in the East of Asia: And were alwayes in admiration that I had
no fellow Pilgrime, in my long Peregrination.

<p class="xd29e5248"><span class="xd29e5248init">J</span>erusalem, is now called by the Turkes, Kuddish, which is in their Language, a Holy
Citie: It was first called Moriah, of Moria, one of the seaven heads of Syon, where
Abraham would have sacrificed Isaac, Gen. 22. 2. and upon his offering <span class="marginnote"><i>Jerusalems antiquity.</i></span>it was called Jerusalem, Gen. 14. 18. It was also named Salem, where Sem, or Melchisedech
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213">213</a>]</span>dwelt: and Jerusalem was also called Jebus, 2. Sam. 24. 16. And it is the place where
Salomon was commanded to build the Temple, 2. Chron: 3. 1. which afterward was termed
Hieron Salomonis, whence came by corruption, that word Hierosolyma. David, also in
his Psalmes gave it divers names. And Jerusalem in the Arabick tongue is also called
Beyt almo kadas: Beyt signifieth the house, almo kadas, viz. of Saints.
</p>
<p>Jerusalem standeth in the same place where old Jerusalem stood, but not so populous,
neither in each respect of breadth, or length so spacious: for on the South side of
Jerusalem, a great part of Mount Syon is left without, which was aunciently the heart
of the old City; and they have taken on the North side, now both Mount Calvary, and
the holy grave within the walles, which were built by Sultan Selim: So that thereby
the <span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 239.]</span>difference of the situation is not so great, though a part thereof be removed; but
a man may boldly affirme, that the most part of this City is builded on that place,
where the first Jerusalem was: as may truely appeare, and is made manifest by these
mountaines, mentioned in the Scriptures, whereupon Jerusalem is both situate, and
environed about, who reserve their names to this day, and are still seene, and knowne
by the same; <span class="marginnote"><i>The foure hills of Jerusalem.</i></span>as Mount Syon, Mount Calvary, Mount Moriah, and Mount Olivet. The forme of the situation
of Jerusalem, is now like to a Hart, or Triangle, the one point whereof looketh East,
extending downeward, almost to the valley of Jehosaphat, which divideth Jerusalem,
and Mount Olivet: The second head or point, bendeth out South-west upon Sion, bordering
neare to the valley of Gehinnon: The third corner lieth on Mount Moriah, toward the
North, and by-West, having its prospect to the buriall place of the Kings of Israel.
</p>
<p>The walles are high and strongly builded with Saxo quadrato, which adorne Jerusalem
more then any thing within it, the Holy Grave excepted. It is of circuite about three
miles, and a halfe of our measure. As touching the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214">214</a>]</span>former glory of this City, I will not meddle withall, nor yet describe, sith the Scriptures
so amply manifest the same; concerning the lamentable destruction of it; I refer that
to the famous Historiographer Josephus, who largely discourseth of many hundred thousands
famished, and put to the sword within this multipotent City, by <span class="marginnote"><i>The triumph of Titus.</i></span>Vespasian, and Titus his sonne; being the messengers of Gods just judgements; which
by his computation did amount beyond the number of eleven hundred thousands. But it
is to be understood, they were not all at one time in Jerusalem; but came up by turnes
and times, from the circumjacent Countries about by thousands, and as they <span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 240.]</span>were cut off so their numbers were aye renewed againe as necessity required.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The overthrow of Jerusalem.</i></span>This City hath beene oft conquered by enemies: First, by Nabuchodanezzar, the Assirian
King: Secondly, by the Greekes, and Alexander the Great, and also marvellously afflicted
by Antiochus: Thirdly, it was taken in by Pompeius: Fourthly, destroyed of Vespasian
and Titus: Fifthly, it was reedified by Adrian the Emperour, and wonne againe by Gosdroes,
the Persian King: Sixtly, it was overcome by Homer Califf the successour of Mahomet:
Seaventhly, by the great Souldan of Egypt, and by Godfrey du Bulloine, a Christiane
Prince: Eightly, by Saladine the Caliph of Egypt, and Damascus: Anno 1187. who reserved
successively the Signiory thereof for a long time: And lastly, it was surprised by
Sultan Selim, or Solyman the Emperour of the Turkes, Anno 1517. joyning the holy Land
together with Ægypt to his Empire, who fortified the same, being by Infidels detayned
to this day: and by likelihood shall keepe it to the consummation of the world, unlesse
God of his mercy deale otherwise, then the hopes of mans weake judgement can expect.
Whence truely I may say, that when fortune would change friendship, she disleagueth
conditionall amity, with the senselesse litargy of foule ingratitude. This City is
now governed by a Sanzack or Subbassaw, being placed there by the Bassaw of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215">215</a>]</span>Damascus, whose Deputie he is; the other being chiefe Ruler under the Grand Signior
over all the holy Land and the halfe of Siria. <span class="marginnote"><i>The Garrison of Jerusalem.</i></span>There is a strong Garrison kept alwayes in Jerusalem, to withstand the Arabish invasions,
consisting of eight hundred Souldiers, Turkes, and Moores, who are vigilant in the
night and circumspect in the day time, so that none can enter the Towne <span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 241.]</span>without their knowledge; nor yet goe forth without their triall. This is a memorable
note, and worthy of observation, that at that time, when the Cities of Jerusalem and
Antiochia were recoverd from the Pagans by the meanes of Godfrey of Boulloin; the
Pope of Rome that then was, was called Urbanus; the Patriarke of Jerusalem Heraclius,
and the Romane Emperour Fredericke: <span class="marginnote"><i>A notable observation.</i></span>And at the same time, and long thereafter, when Jerusalem was reinthralled and seazed
upon by Saladine; the Popes name was Urbanus; the Patriarke of Jerusalem Heraclius;
and the Romane Emperour Fredericke: After Herod the Idumean, soone to Anti-pater,
in whose time Christ was borne: Archelaus, Agrippa Herod, who imprisoned Peter and
James, and was eaten of vermine, in whose time Christ suffered; and Agrippa minor
(before whom Paul pleaded) the last King of the Jews had raigned, (being strange Kings)
in the last Kings time Jerusalem was overthrowne, and the Kingdome made a Province
of the Romane Empire, Anno 37. After which desolation, the Jewes were over all the
world dispersed; but afterward in a zealous consideration, were banished from the
most part of the Christian Kingdomes: Out of France they were rejected by Philip the
faire, Anno 1307. out of Spaine by Ferdinand the Catholicke, 1492. out of Portugale
by Emanuell, 1497. out of England by Edward the fifth, 1290. out of Naples and Sicilia
by Charles the fifth, 1539. Yet they are found in great numbers in divers parts of
Germany, Poland, and in some Cities of Italy, as Venice and her territories, Florence
and the jurisdiction thereof, the principalities of Parma, Mantua, Modena, Urbino,
and their extending <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216">216</a>]</span>limits; and finally Rome, (besides her Ecclesiasticall papacy) wherein there are no
lesse than twenty thousand <span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 242.]</span>of them: They are also innumerable over all the Turkish dominions, who so misregard
and hate them, for the crucifying of Christ, that they use to say in detestation of
any thing, I would I might dye a Jew; neither will they permit a Jew to turne Turke,
unlesse he first be baptized: And yet live, where they wil, the most part of them
are the welthiest people in the world, having subtile, and sublime spirits. Now for
the severall Kings and Rulers of Judah and Israel, beginning at Moyses, the Judges
of the Jewes were 16. of whom Samuel was the last, at which time, the people desired
to have a King like unto other Nations.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The Jewish Kings.</i></span>The Kings of the Jewes were three; Saul, David, and Salomon; And the Kings of Judah
were twenty, Zedechias being last, in whose time Nabuchodanezzar destroyed Jerusalem.
Of the Kings of Israel there were seaventeene, of whom Oseas was the last, in whose
time the Israelites were carried captives into Assyria, by King Salmanassor.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Dukes of Jewry.</i></span>The Dukes or Governours of Jewry were fifteene, of which Joannes Hircanius, was the
last Governour of Judea, which discended from the stocke of David. During the government
of which Captaines, after the Babylonian captivity, the Jewish Kingdome was plagued
on both sides, by the Kings of Egypt and Syria: who slaughtered their people, ransacked
their Cities, made havocke of their goods, and compelled them to eate forbidden flesh,
and sacrifice to Idols.
</p>
<p>To reforme which enormities Matathias and his five sonnes valiantly resisted, and
overcame the impetuous fury of Antiochus Epiphanes and his Syrians: Whereupon the
Jewes chose Judas surnamed Machabeus for their Captaine, one of the worlds nine Worthies;
who though not of the line of David, was yet of the tribe of Judah.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 243.]</span>The Machabean Princes of Jury were onely foure: Joannes Hircanus the last, who was
slaine by the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217">217</a>]</span>Parthianes. <span class="marginnote"><i>The Machabean Princes.</i></span>Of the Machabean Kings of Judah were other foure, of whom Hircanus sonne to Alexander
the tyrant was the last, who being disturbed in his raigne by Aristobulus his yonger
brother, with his sonnes Alexander and Antiochus, he was firmely established in his
throne by Pompey; &amp; the other carried captives to Rome. But afterward Alexander and
Antiochus escaping, the one by pollicy, the other by favour of Julius Cæsar, villanously
abused Hircanus: The former was slaine by Scipio, and the latter for his villany was
slaine by Marcus Antonius, and the Kingdome given to a stranger, Herod borne in Ascolon
of Idumea, as I formerly recited, of which strange Kings there were foure.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Christian Kings of Jerusalem.</i></span>The Christian Kings of Palestine, beginning at Godfrey of Bulloine were nine. Guy
of Lysingham being the last King of Jerusalem, and was surprised by Saladine of Egypt,
1187.
</p>
<p>And lastly, or at this present time, the Emperours of the line and race of Ottoman,
are Lords and Kings over Jerusalem, and the crost, or rather now curst land of Canaan:
In whose hands it is faster kept, then the seventeene Belgian Provinces, remaine totally
subject to the Spanish power.
</p>
<p>But to the intent the Reader may the better conceive, and plainely understand the
Monuments I saw within Jerusalem, and the circumjacent places of Judea; I thought
best to prefixe the description thereof, by the severall dayes as I saw them, not
much condemning, neither absolutely qualifying them, but shall (as it were) neutrally
nominate, and recapitulate these places, as I was informed <span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 244.]</span>by the Padre Guardiano, Gaudentius, Saybantus, a Veronesen borne; whence he, and every
one of them every third yeare are changed and recalled backe to Christendome, and
other new Friers sent in their places: And especially the information of John Baptista,
the Trenchman, who dwelt and had stayed twenty five yeares in Jerusalem, and from
whom the Friers themselves have their informations: for a stranger that understandeth
not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218">218</a>]</span>promptly the Italian tongue, which they usually speake, when they demonstrate these
places unto us, hee shall <span class="marginnote"><i>The ignorance of Travellers.</i></span>conceive ignorantly, dispose his judgement blind-foldedly, and knowes not how to distinguish
the circumstances, and qualities of the things delivered. As I have knowne some of
these Francks, in my company, simply mistaken, even when the exposition of every object
was largely manifested unto them; and precisely declared such a thing to have beene
there, although perhaps the matter it selfe, be evanished and transported.
</p>
<p>About two of the clock on Palme-sunday after dinner, for all of us eate, drunke, and
lay in the Monastery, each of us paying a Piaster a day for our dyet, sixe shillings
starling, besides all other costs and charges: The Guardian I say, departed from Jerusalem
to Bethphage: accompanied with twelve Friers, and many other Orientall Christians,
which were come thither to that Festivall time, but I by no meanes would go, neither
would the six Germans, but reposing our selves on the top or platforme of the Cloyster,
we stayed till their returne: And yet from this place, we saw their back-comming from
Bethphage as they crossed the lower and South side of Olivet; devalling downeward,
toward the valley of Jehosophat to ascend Mount Sion, for the greater performance
of their foolery.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 245.]</span><span class="marginnote"><i>A superstitious Ceremony.</i></span>The rediculous Ceremony which that day they use, is thus: In an Apish imitation of
Christ, at the foresayd Bethphage, there was an Asse brought to the Guardiano, whereupon
hee mounted (being as it were, the greater Asse, riding upon the lesser) and came
riding to Jerusalem, the people cutting downe Boughs of trees, and also dispoyling
themselves almost to the skin, bestrewed the way as hee Rode along, crying, Hosanna,
Hosanna, the Sonne of David, blessed is hee that commeth in the name of the Lord:
untill they came to the South gate of Syon, where the Guardian thought to have entred,
Riding through Jerusalem to his monastery, with this shouting convoy of sixe thousand
Orientall Christians, because their Patriarkes have not that liberty to do so, as
this Italian <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219">219</a>]</span>Guardian: Notwithstanding, the clamour of the people incensed so the Turkish Garrison
lying at this Gate, that they not onely abused the poore Christians in their ignorant
devotion, but they pulled the Guardian also from the Asses backe, beating him most
cruelly, and all the rest of the Friers and Francke Pilgrimes that were with him:
Where at last entring the Convent, most of them came in groaning, and loaden with
blacke and bloody blowes; whereat I, and the other Protestants, did laugh in our sleeves
to behold their foolish Procession, so substantially rewarded. At night after Supper,
the Guardiano knowing that I was a Protestant, and also these other Germanes, made
an Oration, saying: You Pilgrims, who refuse to be participant with us in the Sacraments,
nor wil not adhere to our Masses, processions and Ceremonies <span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 246.]</span>which we follow of the Roman Church: I would therfore intreat you (your liberty being
here as much as mine, whereby you may do as you please) onely to abstaine from scandalling
and mocking our Rites and ordinary Customes, which at this great feast we must performe:
To which we condescended, and promised to give no occasion of offence, seeing our
outward carriage in going along with them to see their customes, tended no way to
hurt the inward disposition of our soules.
</p>
<p>In the conclusion of his long Exhortation, hee disclosed this admonition, saying:
All of you Travailers must in <span class="marginnote"><i>A flattering beggary.</i></span>general be indued with these three worthy gifts, Faith, Patience, &amp; Mony: Faith, to
beleeve these things you shall see here at, and about Jerusalem: Patience, to indure
the apparent injuries of Infidels; and Money, to discharge all tributes, and costs,
which here (meaning in his owne Monastery) and about this City must be defrayed. His
Sermon he concluded like a Grey Frier, as indeede hee was: for I am fully perswaded
hee little cared for our Faith, and Patience, providing, that our purses could answere
his expectation, as truly we found the condigne trial thereof afterward: making our
Patience to startle, our Faith to over-top his lyes, and our monies to bee a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220">220</a>]</span>slave to his greed; and wee left the last tributary spoyles of two extortionable flatterers,
Avarice, and Ignorance; with the which our Reverend Guardian was fully invested.
</p>
<p>Monday earely, we Pilgrimes went foorth to view the monuments within the Citty, being
accompanied with the Padre Viccario, and a French Predicatore: the places of any note
wee saw were these: first they shewed us the place where Christ appeared to Mary Magdalen,
who sayd: Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my Father, John 20. 15. and this
place by them is supposed to be the Center or middle part of the World. Next, where
Saint James the first Bishop of the Primitive Church was beheaded: then the House
of Saint Thomas, but that <span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 247.]</span>is doubtful (say they) because it is not yet confirmed by the Papall Authority: From
thence they brought us to the place where Annas one of the High Priests dwelt, and
also the Tree to the which our Saviour was bound, whiles Annas was making himselfe
ready to leade him to Caiphas; but that I wil not beleeve, for that Tree groweth yet,
being an Olive Tree. They shewed us also the house where Saint Peter was imprisoned,
when his fetters were shaken off his legges, and the Prison doores cast open, and
hee relieved: And where Zebedeus the Father of James and John dwelt, which are nothing
but a lumpe of Ruines.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Caiphas Lodging.</i></span>Thence wee came to the decayed lodging of Caiphas, without the Citty, uppon the mount
Syon, whereupon there is a Chappell builded, and at the entry of that little Domo,
we saw the stone, on which the Cocke crew, when Peter denied Christ. Within the same
place is the stone that was rolled to the Sepulcher doore of our Saviour, being now
made an Altar to the Abasines. These Abasines, are naturally borne blacke, and of
them silly Religious men, who stay at Jerusalem, in two places, to wit, heere at Caiphas
House, on mount Syon, and the other Convent on mount Moriah, where Abraham would have
sacrificed Isaac: They weare on their heads flat round Caps of a blackish colour,
and on their bodies long gownes of white <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221">221</a>]</span>Dimmety, or linnen cloath, representing Ephods: the condition of themselves being
more devoute, than understanding the true grounds or their devotion, blind zeale and
ignorance overswaying their best light of knowledge. They being a kinde of people,
which came from Prester Jehans dominions.
</p>
<p>And within that Chappel they shewed us a narrow pit, <span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 248.]</span>wherein (say they) Christ was incarcerat, the night before he was brought to the Judgement
Hall. Upon the same side of Syon, we saw the place, where Christ did institute the
Sacraments: and not far hence, a decayed House, where (say they) the Holy-Ghost discended
upon the Apostles, and also the Sepultures of David, and his sonne Salomon: Over the
which, there is a Moskie, wherein no Christian may enter, to see these monuments.
For the Turkes doe great Reverence, to most of all the ancient Prophets of the old
Testament.
</p>
<p>From thence we returned, and entred in via dolorosa, the dolorous way, by which our
Lord and Savior passed, when he went to be crucified, carrying the Crosse upon his
Backe: And at the end of the same streete (say they) the Souldiers met Simon of Cyrene,
and compelled him to helpe Christ, to beare his Crosse when hee fainted. <span class="marginnote"><i>Pilats judgement Hall.</i></span>Pilats Judgment Hall, is altogether ruinated, having but onely betweene the two sides
of the Lane, an olde Arch of stone, under the which I passed, standing ful in the
high Way: Here they shewed us the place, where Christ first tooke up his Crosse, and
on the top of that Arche, wee saw that place called Gabbatha, where Jesus stood, when
Pilat sayd to the Jewes, Ecce homo.
</p>
<p>A little below this, they brought us to the Church of Saint Anna, where (say they)
the Virgin Mary was borne. And going downe another narrow Lane, they poynted in to
a House, and sayd, heere Dives the rich Glutton dwelt, who would not give to Lazarus
the Crummes of Bread that fel from his Table: this I suspend, amongst many other things,
for all hold it to bee a Parable, and not a History: And although it were a History,
who can demonstrate <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222">222</a>]</span>the particular place, Jerusalem having beene so often transformed by alterations.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 249.]</span>This I must needes say, with such leying wonders, these flattering Friers, bring Strangers
into a wonderful admiration, and although I rehearse all I saw there, yet I will not
beleeve all, onely publishing them as things indifferent, some whereof are frivolous,
and others somewhat more credible: But as I sayd before, I will make no (or very small)
distinction in the Relation.
</p>
<p>From thence we came without the Easterne gate, (standing on a low Banke, called the
daughter of Syon, that over-toppeth the valley of Jehosophat,) unto an immoveable
stone, upon the which they sayd St. Stephen was stoned to death, the first Martyr
of the Christian faith; and the faithfull fore-runner of many noble followers. As
we returned to our owne Convent, they brought us to mount Moriah, and shewed us the
place where <span class="marginnote"><i>Abrahams faith.</i></span>Abraham offered up Isaac, which is in the custody of Nigroes or Æthiopians: to whom
each of us payed ten Madins of Brasse, the common coine of Jerusalem, for our in going
to that place. And the other monastery that these Abasines detaine, is on mount Sinay
in the Desarts, where the body of S. Katherine lyeth buried, which is richly maintained,
and strongly kept by the Æthiopian Emperor: There are 200. Religious Abasines in it,
and 100. souldiers to guard them from the incursions of Arabs, who continually molest
them, because <span class="marginnote"><i>Mount Sinay.</i></span>mount Sinay standeth in midst of that desolate Arabian wildernesse, and far from any
civill or inhabited place; being distant from Jerusalem about 70. English miles. Next
they shewed us the place where Jesus sayd, Daughters of Jerusalem, mourne not for
me, &amp;c. And neere unto this, where the virgin Mary fell into an agony, when Jesus
passed by carrying his Crosse: Also, not farre hence, we beheld the place, where (as
they say) Jesus said to his mother, woman, behold thy Sonne, and to S. John behold
thy mother.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 250.]</span>Ascending more upward, they shewed us the house of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href="#pb223">223</a>]</span>Veronica Sancta, and said, that our Saviour going by her doore, all in a sweat to
Mount Calvary, she brought him a napkin to wipe his face; which he received, and gave
it to her againe: in which (say they) the print of his face remaineth to this day,
and is to be seene at Rome. It is also sayd to be in a Towne in Spaine, and another
of them at Palermo in Sicilia: wherefore I beleeve the one, as well as the rest.

<p class="first"><span class="marginnote"><i>The Temple of Solomon thrice builded &amp; destroyed.</i></span>As concerning the Temple of the most high, built by Salomon (the description of which
edifice yee may read in the 3. of Kings) it was destroyed by Nabuchodanezzar, at the
taking of Jerusalem, Anno Mundi, 4450. Secondly, it was rebuilded againe by the commandement
of Cyrus King of Persia, after the Jewes returned from the Captivity of Babylon; but
not answerable to the state and magnificence of the former: For besides the poverty
&amp; smalnesse of it, there wanted five things which were in the other: First, the Arke
of the Covenant: Secondly, the pot of Manna: thirdly, the rod of Aaron: Fourthly,
the two tables of the Law, written by the finger of God: And fifthly, the fire of
the Sacrifice, which came downe from Heaven, which were the Symboles and badges of
Gods favour and mercy showne to them and their fore-fathers in his covenant of Love.
</p>
<p>This Temple afterward growing in decay, Herod the <span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 251.]</span>great, (that killed the young Infants for Christs sake, who suffered for him, before
he suffered for them) built another much inferiour to the first, and superiour to
the second. And although some Authors would have him but to repaire the second Temple,
yet it is most certaine, he did even from the foundation raise its greatest beauty
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224">224</a>]</span>glory. For this Herod the Ascolonite, was an Edomit stranger, or Idumean, who having
gotten the Kingdome contrary to the Law of Moses; and created King of Jewry by Octavius
Augustus; and knowing these people to be offended therewithall, to procure their favour
did <span class="marginnote"><i>Herod the Idumeans Temple.</i></span>build to them a third Temple: This was it, in which our Saviour, and his Apostles
did daily Preach; and was set on fire by Titus the tenth day of August, on which day
likewise the first Temple, was burnt by Nabuchodanezzar. And lastly there is another
great Temple builded in the <span class="marginnote"><i>Selim Solimans Temple.</i></span>same place, by Sultan, Selim Soliman, reserved by Turkes, and highly regarded, for
that respect they carry to Salomon; neare the which, or within whose courts no Christian
may enter under the paine of loosing his head.
</p>
<p>This present Temple hath two incircling Courts invironed with high wals, having two
enteries: In the inner Court standeth the Temple, that is composed of five circling
and large Rotundoes, rising high and incorporate from the ground with round tops:
The outward fabrick whereof we cannot see, save on Mount Olivet, which is over against
the Citie, and twice as high as Mount Sion.
</p>
<p>These are all the monuments which in one day, I saw within Jerusalem; but as for Mount
Calvary, and the Holy Grave, I saw them afterward, which in their owne place shall
be orderly touched. As we were spending that <span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 252.]</span>day in these sights, the Guardian had prepared one hundred souldiers, sixty horse-men,
and forty foot-men, to take with him the day following, for his conduction to Jordan,
and the mountaine in the Wildernesse where Christ fasted; which is his usuall custome
once every yeare betweene Palme-sunday and Easter, returning againe before Good-friday.
These places cannot be viewed, save onely at that time; neither may a Pilgrime goe
along with the souldiers, unlesse he give the value of seven Crownes or Piasters (as
a propyne) unto the Lieutenant, being forty two shillings starling: and if the Traveller
will not goe to that charge, he may stay there till their returne, which I would not
wish him to doe, if possibly he may spare <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225">225</a>]</span>the money, for the sight of Sodome, and Jordans sake. That same night after supper,
the Guardian demanded of us Travellers, if we would goe with him to see these memorable,
&amp; singular things, upon the former condition: To whom we answered, in a generall consent,
we would, and so payed our moneyes.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>A voyage to Jordan.</i></span>Earely upon Tuesday morning all the Friers and Pilgrimes being mounted on Mules save
onely pedestriall I, and two Mules loaden with our provision of victuals; we departed
from the City, about our nine of the clocke in the forenoone, keeping our faces South-east,
and leaving Bethphage and Bithania on our left hand, wee had pleasant travelling for
seaven miles; but in the afternoone wee entred in a barren and desart Countrey till
Sun-setting: where at last wee arrived at a standing Well, and there refreshing our
selves and the beasts, wee reposed till two houres within night. After that the Captaine
had cried Catethlanga, that is, march away: we set forward, being well guarded round
about with our keepers, because we entred into a dangerous way, and a most desolate
and fabulous soile.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 253.]</span>In all this deformed Countrey, wee saw neyther house, nor Village, for it is altogether
desartuous, and inhabited onely by wilde Beasts, and naked Arabians. Before wee came
neere to Sodom and Gomorrah, by seaven miles: (for so wee behooved to passe by the
East end of it, before wee could arrive at that place of Jordan which wee intended)
we I say incountred with such deep sandy ground, that the Mulets were not able to
carry our Company through: Whereupon they all dismounted, wrestling, and wading above
the middle part of their bodies, and sometimes falling in over their heads, they were
in great danger of perishing, although the robustnesse of my body carried mee through
on my feete, relieving also divers times some of these Friers and Pilgrimes, that
were almost choaked and over-whelmed with Sand, but not for lacke of Wine. Even in
the middest of this turmoyling paine, (the night being darke) the unwelcomed Arabs,
environed, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226">226</a>]</span><span class="marginnote"><i>A fearefull danger.</i></span>and invaded us with a storme of Arrowes, which they sent from the tops of little hard
hils, whereupon they stood, for knowing the advantage of the ground: they tooke opportunity
to give the more feareful assaults: yet they prevailed nothing (although they wounded
some of our Souldiers) such was the resolute Courage of our valourous Defendants.
True it is, that in all my travailes I was never so sore fatigated, nor more fearefully
indangered, as I was that night.
</p>
<p>A little after midnight, these Savages leaving us, and wee leaving our troublesome
way, we accoasted the Lake of Sodome, and marched along the marine shoare above nine
miles before we came to Jordan. This Lake is called Lacus Asphaltites, it yeeldeth
a kinde of slime, named Bitumen Asphaltum; the which bituminous savour no <span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 254.]</span>living thing can indure. And now Mare mortuum, a sea because it is salt, and mortuum
or dead, for that no living thing breedes therein: and more properly for this cause
called the dead Sea, because of it selfe it is unmoveable, such is the Leprosie and
stability of the water. It is also called so, because if a Bird flye over it, shee
presently falleth downe therein dead: And as Salomon reporteth of it, Wisdom. 10.
7. it smoaketh continually: from whence proceedeth filthy Vapours, which deforme the
fields, lying about for certaine miles, as it were blasted, scorched, and made utterly
barren: this smoake I take onely to be but the exhalation of Jordan: For this River
falling into it, and there ending his course, the two contrary natures cannot agree;
the one being a filthy puddle, and the other a pure water, as I shall more approbably
Record.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The length of Sodoms Lake.</i></span>This Lake is foure score miles in length, and according to its intervalling Circuite,
sometimes two, three, foure, or five miles in breadth: yet the body thereof, bending
directly South-west; keepeth a glassie course, till it salute the austiere conspicuosity
of the sabulous and stony Desarts: beeing compassed with the Rockes of Arabia Petrea
on the South: On the North, with the sandy hils <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227">227</a>]</span>of the Wildernesse of Judea: on the West, with the steepy mountaines of Arabia deserta:
and on the East, with the plaine of Jericho. How commeth it to passe therefore, that
the fresh running flood of Jordan, falling evermore into this bounded Sea, that the
Lake it selfe, never diminisheth, nor increaseth, but alwayes standeth at one fulnesse:
neyther hath it any issuing forth, nor reboundeth backewards on the plaine of Jericho,
which is one of the greatest wonders in the World. Wherefore, as I have <span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 255.]</span>sayd, it must needes eyther exhale to the Clouds, or otherwise runne downe to Hell:
for if it ranne under the Rockes, and so burst in the Desarts, it would soone bee
knowne; but in all the bounds of Arabia Deserta, which betwixt this Lake and the Red
Sea, extend to 300. miles; there is no such matter, as Brooke, or strand, much lesse
a River, neyther hath it any intercourse with the Ocean, unlesse it runne through
some secret passage of the earth under the Wildernesse, unto the Red sea. And that
is doubtfull, although it may appeare probable; in regard of Nilus, that runneth a
hundred miles under the ground in the exterior Æthiopia: and divers other Rivers also
after the same manner, obscuring themselves under Rockes, mountaynes, and planures,
for many miles: which particulars, by my owne experience, I could denote.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The doubtfulnes of Jordans ending.</i></span>But as for this River, the question may arise, whether ran it during the time of these
five Citties of the plaine, now overwhelmed with Water; or where was the issue thereof.
To this I answere, was not the hand of the Almighty, that rained downe from the Heavens
fire and Brimstone to consume them, able also, to drowne their situations and intervalling
plaines with water: Yes and doubtlesse yes, and the course of the River keeping still
its former condition: And for moderne examples, how many Citties, Mansions, and Stations,
have beene sommerssed with water: nay innumerable, and so remayning to this day, place,
beauty, and being, all defaced: As now in Scotland neere to Falkirk, rests the last
and latest <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228">228</a>]</span>memory of such woefull accidents, and superabounding disgorgings.
</p>
<p>It breedeth nor reserveth no kinde of fishes; and if by the swelling of Jordan, any
fishes be carried to it, they immediatly dye. Although Josephus witnesseth, that in
<span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 256.]</span>his time, there was an Apple grew uppon the Bankes thereof, like to the colour or
gold, and within was rotten, and would consume to powder; yet I affirme now the contrary:
For there is not such a thing (whatsoever hath beene in his dayes) as eyther Trees,
or Bushes, grow neere to Sodome by three miles: such is the consumation of that pestiferous
Gulfe.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Wrong informations made false.</i></span>Divers Authors have reported, that nothing will sinke into it, of any reasonable weight,
as dead men, or Carkasses of Beasts: but by experience I approve the contrary: For
it beareth nothing at all; yea, not the weight of a Feather, nor the pile of withered
Grasse, but it will sinke therein, with the which my hands made sundry trials; and
dare approove it to be of trueth, in spight of the leying world, and all doting varieties
of auncient Relations.
</p>
<p>The water it selfe, is of a blackish colour, and at sometimes in the yeare, there
are terrible shapes, and showes of terrour in it, as I was informed at Jericho, by
the Arabian inhabitants there, which is the neerest Towne that bordereth thereupon.
</p>
<p>This contagious and pestilentious Lake of Sodome, resembleth much (as may be supposed)
that infernall gulfe of Hell: but in my opinion, I hold it to be the Purgatory of
Papists: for they say Limbus Patrum, is neere, or in the second roome to Hell, which
I thinke must needs be Sodome: for although it be not Hell it selfe, yet I am perswaded,
it is a second Hell, having (as some report) no bottome. Wherefore I conclude thus,
that since Papists will have a Purgatory, I absolutely affirme, it must be such a
Purgatory, as the purging of Sodome and Gomorra, which was with fire and Brimstone,
to their destruction.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229">229</a>]</span>
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 257.]</span>About the breach of day on Wednesday morning, we past by the ruines of an old house;
where (as they say) S. John the Baptist remained, when he baptized those that came
from Jerusalem, and other Regions about, which is but the flight of an arrow from
Jordan.
</p>
<p>Approaching to the banke-side, we dismounted, and <span class="marginnote"><i>The River Jordan.</i></span>uncloathed our selves, going in naked to the River, we washed us to refresh our bodies;
our Souldiers lying a little off from us, as pledges of our lives, and their owne
safegards, stayed as Bulwarks for our <span class="corr" id="xd29e5547" title="Source: potection">protection</span>, &amp; a connivall obligation for two repugnant defences: Time presenting the awfull
opportunity of both occasions. In this place, as the Guardian said, was Christ baptized
of S. John, when the Holy Ghost came downe in a bodily shape, like a Dove upon him,
and there was a voyce from Heaven, saying: Thou art my beloved Sonne, in Thee I am
well pleased. I saw also an apparant like testimony, of a quadrangled stone, lying
on the banke side; <span class="corr" id="xd29e5550" title="Source: wherupon">whereupon</span> are ingraven letters, of Hebrew, Greeke, Latine, testifying the same thing: and may
be also conjectured, in regard of the auncient Habitacle, of that precursor, which
is not far from thence.
</p>
<p>This river Jordan beginneth in Mount Libanus, of two fountaines, Jore, and Dan, which
runne separated, till they come to the lake Maronah; &amp; hence it maketh one body, keeping
his course through the lake Genasereth, endeth in Sodome. The river Tibris at Rome,
&amp; Jordan are not much different in quantity and colour; and not unlike other in their
courses: For Jordan falleth in the old Gomorah, and Tibris runneth through the new
Sodome; A history of such evidence, as travell taught me by experience: For it is
the Priests confluence, which breeds in the Italians insolence: If I erre, I will
beg indulgence, of the Popes aureat magnificence.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 258.]</span>The rivers themselves are both of a muddy colour, and their quantity not far different
from other, which Jordan for greatnesse retaineth, and the length of their courses
are much semblable to other. The water of Jordan hath <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230">230</a>]</span>beene transported to Venice in barrels, for that purity it hath; which will reserve
unspoiled, both moneths and yeares, and the longer it is kept, it is the more fresher;
and to drinke it, is an excellent remedy for the fever quartan or quotidian, being
neare in vertue to the Wine of Libanon.
</p>
<p>Considering the auncient reputation of this famous river, and the rare sight of such
an unfrequented place, <span class="marginnote"><i>A Turpentine rod brought from Jordan and given to King James.</i></span>I climbed up to the top of a Turpentine tree, which grew within the limited flood,
a little above where I left my company even naked, as I came from swimming, and cut
downe a faire hunting rod of the heavy and sad Turpentine tree, being three yards
long, wondrous straight, full of small knots, and of a yellowish colour; which afterward,
with great paines, I brought to England, and did present it (as the rarest gemme of
a Pilgrimes treasure) to his Majesty. But I remember in the choosing thereof an unexpected
accident fell out: For I being sequestrat from the sight of the company, upon this
solitary tree, with broad obscuring leaves, the Friers and Souldiers removed; keeping
their course towards Jericho: but within two furlongs from Jordan, they were beset
with the former Nocturnall enemies, who assailed them with a hard conflict: For I
hearing the Harquebuse go off, was straight in admiration, and looking downe to the
place where I left my associates, they were gone; so bending my eyes a little further
in the Plaine, I saw them at a martiall combate: which sight gave me suddenly, the
threatning of despaire: not knowing whether to stay intrenched, <span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 259.]</span>within the circundating leaves, to approve the events of my auspicuous fortunes: Or
in prosecuting a reliefe, to be participant of their doubtfull deliverance. In the
end pondering, I could hardly, or never escape their hands, either there, or by the
way going up to Jerusalem, leapt downe from the tree, leaving my Turkish cloathes
lying upon the ground, tooke onely in my hand the rod &amp; Shasse which I wore on my
head; and ranne starke naked above a quarter of a mile amongst thistles, and sharpe
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231">231</a>]</span>pointed grasse, which pittifully be pricked the soles of my feete, but the feare of
death for the present, expel&#x2019;d the griefe of that unlooked for paine. Approaching
on the safe side of my company, one of our Souldiers broke forth on horsebacke, being
determined to kill mee for my staying behinde: Yea, and three times stroke at me with
his halfe-pike; but his horse being at his speed, I prevented his cruelty, first by
falling downe, next by running in amongst the thickest of the Pilgrimes, recovering
the Guardians face, which when the Guardian espied, and saw my naked body, hee presently
pulled off his gray gowne, and threw it to me, whereby I might hide the secrets of
nature: By which meanes, (in the space of an <span class="marginnote"><i>The Pilgrimes three severall habits in halfe a houre.</i></span>houre) I was cloathed three manner of wayes: First, like a Turke: Secondly, like a
wild Arabian: And thirdly, like a grey Frier, which was a barbarous, a savage, and
a religious habit.
</p>
<p>The Captaine at last entering in parley with the Arabs, by some contributing promises
did mitigate their fury, for their compounded acknowledgement was to be sent them
from Jerusalem: Whereupon, wee marching toward Jericho, reposed our selves under a
cooling shade, and dined there on the Wine and provision carryed with us.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 260.]</span>After Dinner wee arose, and went to the House of Zacheus: (this was hee who sate uppon
a Tree to see our Saviour as he passed by,) the Wals whereof stand to this day, the
tecture being onely demolished. This new Jericho is now a poore Village onely of nine
dwelling houses, inhabited by a kinde of Arabs (which are in subjection under the
Governour of Jerusalem,) but I saw many ruinous lumpes of the Wals, and demolishings
of the old Towne, which is a little from this distant, about a short quarter of a
mile. <span class="marginnote"><i>Two sorts of rare fruit.</i></span>Here I saw two most dainty kinde of fruites, the one was a little lesser then an Apple,
but more round: whose colour was like gold without, and within it was White as Snow,
and sweete like Suger. I would gladly have eaten of them; but the Friers forbade me,
saying; they were the onely pest of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232">232</a>]</span>Death unto a stranger. The other Apple was like to a greene Lemmon, long, and full
of knots, of a reddish colour, like to a Mellone; being both delicate and wholesome,
of which wee did eate to satisfie the naturall appetite, and so did all our Souldiers
eate of them excessively: their Trees growing high and greene by a Brooke side of
delicate Water that runneth from the fountaine of Elizeus. From Jericho we set forward,
in the way of the Wildernesse; our determination being such, as to view the mountaine
whereon Christ fasted forty dayes: Where arrived, being late, we durst not go up til
morning. <span class="marginnote"><i>Elizeus Fountaine.</i></span>Wherefore we pitched that night by the fountayne of Elizeus; the Water of which, was
of old, naturally bitter, but by the prayers of that divine Prophet, was restored
to a sweet tast: It is good in digestion, and harmelesse for health: and it is the
lightest water the earth yeelds: having on the morrow filled a Boares skin of it,
to carry with me to the mountaine; I found it so light, that I <span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 261.]</span>had no weight nor paine in the bearing of it on my shoulders: notwithstanding, the
way of it selfe was fastidious. This mountain is called Quarantanam, or Quaranto,
being of height, by the computation of my painefull experience, above sixe miles,
and groweth from the bottome still smaller and smaller, till that the top is covered
with a little Chappell, not unlike to the proportion of a Pyramede.
</p>
<p>There is no way to ascend upon this Hill, save one, which hath beene hewen out of
the Rocke, by the industry of men, experimented in Masonry; (which was done at the
cost of Queene Helen) going up by the Degrees of forty five turnes. In all our Company
there were onely one Frier, foure Germanes, and I, that durst attempt to climbe the
mountaine.
</p>
<p>Thursday earely at the breach of day, we sixe made us for the mountaine, leaving our
Souldiers to guard the passage below, least some stragling Arabs should have stolne
after us for our Destruction. Where after diverse turnings, traversings, and narrow
foot passages having <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233">233</a>]</span>come with great difficulty to the top, we entred first into a umbragious Cave, joyning
to, and under the Chappell, <span class="marginnote"><i>Where Christ fasted forty dayes.</i></span>where the Frier told us, that in this place Christ did fast forty dayes: and here
it was, where he rebuked Sathan. The Chappel which covereth the top of this high and
steepy Rocke is covered, and also beautified, with an old Altar: betweene the outward
sides whereof, and the craggy face of this mountaine, two men may only go side to
side: Here we dined and refresht our selves with water that I carried on my backe
hither: From which place we saw the most part of all the Holy Land, except the North
parts of Judea, Palestine, and Phenicia, and a great way in the two Arabiaes, Petrea,
and Deserta, and all the length of Jordan, even from Sodome to Maronah.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 262.]</span>At last in our Returne and fearefull discending, there would none of us goe downe
formost: For although the Frier led us freely upwards, yet first downeward for his
life hee durst not goe: and that because at the narrow end of every turning, there
was aye betweene the upper and the lower passage, about my height, and some where
twice my height, of the flat face of the Rocke, whereon there was nothing but dimples
and holes to receive our feete, which in discending was perillous. <span class="marginnote"><i>Dreadfull danger in descending the Quarantatam.</i></span>Now the greatest danger, at every turne, was in the downe going of the formost, who
was to receive, them all, one by one, and foote their feet in the shallow dimples:
of which if any of them had missed, his sliding downe had miscarried them both over
the Rocke.
</p>
<p>Now for the noble Germanes sake, two of whom were great Barens, Signior Strowse, and
Signior Crushen, and borne Vassals to the Marquesse of Hanspauch, I resolved to imbrace
the danger: Where downe I went, receiving every one of them, at every turne, first
leading their feete by my hands, and then by inveloping them with mine armes: Well,
having past halfe way downewards, wee came to the most scurrile and timorous Discent
of the whole passage, where with much difficulty, I set safe the foure Germanes in
our narrow Rode hewen out of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234">234</a>]</span>the craggy Hill; and then was to receive the Frier: Whence hee comming downe from
above, with his Belly and face to the Rocke, holding his hands grumbling above, the
fellow fell on trembling; and as I was placing his feete in the holes, distempred
feare brought him downe upon me with a rushling hurle: Whereuppon straight I mainly
closed with my left arme his body fast to the Rocke, keeping strongly my Right shoulder
to the same <span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 263.]</span>place: For I could not have saved my selfe, and letting him fall, but hee would have
caught mee headlong with him, over the Rocke: And yet the Germanes cryed still to
me, <span lang="it">Lascia ti quel furfanto cascar alla fondo con il Diavolo, e salva caro fratello la
vita vostra</span>, viz. Let that Villaine fall to the ground with the Divell, and save, O deare brother,
your owne life: But I neyther would nor durst: at last his feare, by my incouragement
having left him, I suffered him to slide softly downe betweene my arme and the Rocke,
to the solid path: Where by and by, hee fell downe uppon his knees, and gave mee a
thousand Blessings, vowing for this, he would doe me a great good deede before I left
Jerusalem.
</p>
<p>At last towards the afternoone, wee safely arrived at the foote of the Mountayne,
and having saluted the Guardian, and all the Rest, who then were ready to take journey,
the Frier told his Reverence how I had saved his life: Whereupon the Guardian, and
the other Friers, did imbrace me kindly in their Armes, giving me many earnest and
loving thankes.
</p>
<p>And now the Souldiers and wee being advanced in our Way, as wee returned to Jerusalem,
wee marched by an <span class="marginnote"><i>S. Jeromes Abbey.</i></span>olde Ruinous Abbey, where (say they) Saint Jerome dwelt, and was fed there by wilde
Lyons: Having travailed sore and hard that afternoone, wee arrived at Jerusalem an
houre within night, for the Gate was kept open a purpose for us and our Guard: and
entring our Monastery, wee supped, and rested our selves till midnight; having marched
that halfe Day, more as 34. miles. A little before midnight, the Guardian and the
Friers, were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235">235</a>]</span>making themselves ready to goe with us to the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, called
Sancto Salvatore; where wee were to stay Good-friday and Satturday, and Easter-Sunday
<span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 264.]</span>till mid-night: They tooke their Cooke with them also to dresse our Dyet, carrying
Wine, Bread, Fishes, and Fruites hither in abundance. Meane while, a Jew, the Trench-man
of the Turkies Sanzacke, came to the Monastery, and received from every one of us
Pilgrimes, first two Chickens of Gold, for our severall heads, and entrey at Jerusalem:
and then nine Chickens a peece for our in going to the Holy Grave; and a Chicken of
golde a man, to himselfe the Jew, as beeing due to his place.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Our tributs for the Holy Grave.</i></span>Thus was there twelve Chickens from each of us dispatched for the Turke: And last
one, and all of us, behoved to give to the Guardian two Chickens also for the Waxe
Candles and fooleries hee was to spend, in their idle and superstitious Ceremonies,
these three aforesayd nights, which amounted in all to every one of us, to foureteene
Chickens of gold, sixe pounds sixe shillings starling. So that in the whole from the
sixe Germanes, foure French men, and nine Commercing Franks in Cyprus and Syria, Venetians,
and Ragusans, and from my selfe, the summe arose for this nights labour to a hundred
and twenty sixe pounds starling.
</p>
<p>This done, and at full mid-night wee came to the Church where wee found twelve Venerable
like Turkes, ready to receive us, sitting in the Porch without the Doore; who foorthwith
opened at randone the two great Brazen halfes of the Doore, and received us very respectively:
We being within the doore made fast, and the Turkes returned to the Castle, the first
place of any note we saw, was the place of Unction, which is a foure squared stone;
inclosed about with an yron Reuele, on which (say they) the dead body of our Saviour
lay, and was imbalmed; after hee was taken from the Crosse, whiles <span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 265.]</span>Joseph of Arimathea, was preparing that new Sepulcher for him wherein never man lay:
from thence we came to the holy Grave. Leaving Mount Calvary on our right <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236">236</a>]</span>hand toward the East end of the Church; for they are both contained within this glorious
edifice.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The Holy Grave.</i></span>The Holy Grave is covered with a little Chappell, standing within a round Quiere,
in the west ende of the Church: It hath two low and narrow entries: As we entred the
first doore, three after three, and our shoes cast off, for these two roomes are wondrous
little, the Guardiano fell downe, ingenochiato, and kissed a stone, whereupon (he
sayd) the Angell stood, when Mary Magdalen came to the Sepulchre, to know if Christ
was risen, on the third day as he promised: And within the entry of the second doore,
we saw the place where Christ our Messias was buried, and prostrating our selves in
great humility, every man according to his Religion, offered up his prayers to God.
</p>
<p>The Sepulchre it selfe, is eight foote and a halfe in length, and advanced about three
foote in height from the ground, and three foote five inches broad, being covered
with a faire Marble stone of white colour.
</p>
<p>In this Chappell, and about it, I meane without the utter sides of it, and the inward
incirclings of the compassing Quiere, there are alwayes burning above fifty Lampes
of oyle, maintained by Christian Princes, who stand most of them within incircling
bandes of pure Gold, which is exceeding sumptuous, having the names of those, who
sent or gave them, ingraven upon the upper edges of the round circles: each of them
having three degrees, and each degree depending upon another, with supporters of pure
Gold, rich and glorious. The fairest whereof was sent thither by King John of England,
whereon I saw his <span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 266.]</span>Name, his Title, and crowne curiously indented, I demanded of the Guardiano if any
part of the Tombe was here yet extant, who replied, there was; but because (said he)
Christians resorting thither, being devoutly moved with affection to the place, carried
away a good part thereof, which caused S. Helen inclose it under this stone; whereby
some relicts of it should alwaies remaine. I make no doubt but that same place is
Golgotha, where <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href="#pb237">237</a>]</span>the holy Grave was, as may appeare by the distance, betweene Mount Calvary and this
sacred Monument; which extendeth to forty of my pases: <span class="marginnote"><i>The glorious Chappell of the Holy Grave.</i></span>This Chappell is outwardly decored, with 15. couple of Marble Pillars, and of 22.
foote high; and above the upper coverture of the same Chappell, there is a little
sixe-angled Turret made of Cedar wood, covered with Lead, and beautified with sixe
small Columnes of the same tree. The Chappell it selfe standeth in a demicircle or
halfe Moone, having the little doore or entry looking East: to the great body of the
Church, and to Mount Calvary, being opposite to many other venerable monuments of
memorable majesties.
</p>
<p>The forme of the Quiere wherein it standeth, is like unto that auncient Rotundo in
Rome, but a great deale higher and larger, having two gorgeous Galleries; one above
another, and adorned with magnificent Columnes being open at the top, with a large
round; which yeeldeth to the heavens the prospect of that most sacred place.
</p>
<p>In which second Gallery we strangers reposed all these three nights we remained there:
whence we had the full prospect of all the spacious Church, and all the Orientall
people were there at this great feast of Easter day, being about 6000. persons: from
this curious carved Chappell <span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 267.]</span>we returned through the Church to Mount Calvary; To which we ascended by twenty one
steps, eighteene of them were of Marble, and three of Cedar-wood: where, <span class="marginnote"><i>The beauty of Mount Calvary.</i></span>when we came I saw a most glorious &amp; magnifick roome, whose covert was supported all
about with rich columnes of the Porphyre stone, and the oversilings loaden with Mosaick
worke, &amp; overgilded with gold, the floore being curiously indented with intermingled
Alabaster and black shining Parangone: On my left hand I saw a platformd rocke, all
covered with thicke and ingraven boords of silver; and in it a hole of a cubits deepe,
in which (say they) the Crosse stood whereon our Saviour was crucified: And on every
side thereof a hole for the good &amp; bad theeves, were then put to death with him. Discending
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238">238</a>]</span>from Mount Calvarie, we came to the Tombe of Godfrey du Bulloine, who was the first
proclaimed Christian King of Jerusalem, and refused to be crowned there, saying; It
was not decent, the Servants head should be crowned with gold, where the Maisters
head had beene crowned with thornes; having this Inscription ingraven on the one side:
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Two famous Sepulchers.</i></span>Hic jacet inclytus Godfridus de Bullion, quitotam hanc terram acquisivit cultui divino,
cujus anima requiescat in pace.
</p>
<p>And over against it, is the Tombe of King Baldwine his brother, which hath these Verses
in golden Letters curiously indented.
</p>
<div lang="la" class="lgouter">

<p class="first">The other things within the Church they shewed us, were these, a Marble Pillar, whereunto
(say they) our <span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 268.]</span>Saviour was bound, when he was whipped, and scourged for our sakes: the place in a
low Celler, about fourteene stone degrees under the ground, where the Crosse was hid
<span class="marginnote"><i>Where Christ was nailed to the Crosse.</i></span>by the Jewes, and found againe by S. Helen: the place where Christ was crowned with
thornes, which is reserved by the Abasines, and where the Souldiers cast lots for
his Garment; the place where he was imprisoned, whiles they were making of his Crosse,
and where the Crosse, being laid along upon the ground, our Saviour was nailed fast
to it; the Rocke, which (as they say) rent at his crucifying, which is more likely
to be done with hammers, and set one peece a foote from another, for the slit lookes,
as if it had beene cleft with wedges and beetles. And yet the sacred Scriptures say
that it was not a Rocke, but the Temple that did rent in two from the bottome to the
top, wherein these silly soule-sunke Friers are meerely <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239">239</a>]</span>blinded, understanding no more than leying traditions; perfiting this their nationall

for trueth (I meane in demonstrating the particular places) but onely relates them
as I was informed.
</p>
<p>There are seven sorts of Nations, different in Religion, and language, who continually
(induring life) remaine within this Church, having incloystered lodgings joyning to
the walls thereof: their victuals are brought dayly to them by their familiars, receiving
the same at a great hole <span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 269.]</span>in the Church-doore; for the Turkes seldome open the entry unlesse it be when Pilgrimes
come, save one houres space onely every Saturday in the afternoone, and at some extraordinary
Festivall daies: and yet it doth not stand open then, but onely opened to let strangers
in and shut againe: <span class="marginnote"><i>Seven religious Families.</i></span>For this purpose each family have a Bell fastened at their lodging, with a string
reaching from thence to the Church doore, the end whereof hangeth outwardly, By the
which commodity, each furnisher ringing the Bell, giveth warning to his friends, to
come receive their necessars, for through the body of the Church they must come to
the porch-doore, and returne from it, to the cloyster.
</p>
<p>The number of those, who are tied to this austere life, are about three hundred and
fifty persons, being Italians, Greekes, Armenians, Æthiopians, Jacobines, a sort of
circumcised Christians, Nestorians, and Chelfaines of Mesopotamia.
</p>
<p>The day before the Resurrection, about the houre of mid-night, the whole Sects and
sorts of Christians <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240">240</a>]</span>Orientall (that were come thither in Pilgrimage, and dwelt at Jerusalem) convened
together, which were about the number of sixe thousand men, women, and children: for
being separated by the Patriarkes in two companies, they compassed the Chappell of
the Holy Grave nine times; holding in their hands burning Candles, made in the beginning
pittifull, and lamentable regreetings, but in the ending, there were touking of kettle-drummes,
sounding of horne-trumpets, and other instruments, dauncing, leaping, and running
about the Sepulcher, with an intollerable tumult, as if they had beene all mad, or
distracted of their wits.
</p>
<p>Thus is the prograce of their procession performed in meere simplicitie, wanting civilitie,
and government. <span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 270.]</span>But the Turkes have a care of that; for in the middest of all this hurley burley,
they runne amongst them with long Rods, correcting their misbehaviour with cruell
stroakes: and so these slavish people, even at the height of their Ceremonious devotion
are strangely abused.
</p>
<p>But our Procession begun before theirs, and with a greater regard, because of our
tributes: The Turkes meane while guarding us, not suffering the other Christians to
be participant in the singular dottage of the <span class="marginnote"><i>An abhominable Idolatry.</i></span>Romish folly, being after this manner: First the Guardian, and his Friers brought
forth of a Sacrastia, allotted for the same purpose, the wodden Portracture of a dead
Corpes, representing our Saviour, having the resemblance of five bloody Wounds, the
whole body of which Image, was covered with a Cambricke vale: Where having therewith
thrice compassed the Chappell of the Holy Grave, it was carried to mount Calvary,
and there they imbalmed the five Timber holes; with Salt, Oyle, Balme, and Odoriferous
perfumes.
</p>
<p>Then the Guardian, and the other twelve Friers kneeled downe, and kissed each one
of the five Suppositive Wounds: the Turkes meanewhile laughing them to scorne in their
faces, with miserable derision. Thence <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241">241</a>]</span>they returned, and layd the senselesse blocke uppon the Holy Grave, whence being dismissed,
the Papall Ceremony ended.
</p>
<p>Truely hereupon, may I say, if the Romane Jesuites, Dominicans and Franciscans, there
Resident in certayne speciall parts of the Turkes Dominions, had onely behaved themselves
as their polliticke charge required, and dismissed from the Paganisme eyes, onely
their idolatrous images, veneration of Pictures, Crosses, and the like externall superstitious
Rites: These Infidels I say, had <span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 271.]</span>long agoe (without any insight of Religion) bene converted to the Christian Faith.
For besides all this blindnesse, what infinite abhominable Idolatries commit they
in Italy and Spaine; in clothing the Pictures of dead Abbots, Monkes, Priors, Guardians,
and the better kind of officiall Friers and Priests, with robes of Sattin, Velvet,
<span class="marginnote"><i>Damnable and intolerable superstition.</i></span>Damas, Taffaty, long gownes and coules of cloth, shirts, stockings, and shoes: And
what a number of livelesse portrayed Prioresses, motherlesse Nunnes, yet infinite
mothers, be erected (like the Maskerata of Morice-dancers) in silver, gold, gilded
brasse, yron, stone, tynne, lead, copper, clay, and timber shapes, adorned with double
and triple ornaments: over-wrought with silke, silver, and gold-laces, rich bracelets,
silke grograine, and cambricke vales, chaines, smockes, ruffes, cuffes, gloves, collers,
stockings, garters, pumpes, nose-gayes, beeds, and costly head-geire; setting them
on their Altars, O spectaculous Images! adoring them for gods, in kneeling, praying,
&amp; saying Masses before them: Yet they are none of their avowed, allowed, and canonized
pontificall Saints: for although they be bastards &amp; wooden blocks, yet are they better
clad, then their lupish legitimate ones, no, I may say, as the best Kings daughter
alive. Which is a sinfull, odious, and damnable idolatry; and I freely confesse at
some times, and in some parts I have torne a peeces those rich garments from their
senselesse images and blockes, thinking it a greater sinne not to do it than to stand
staring on such prodigall prophannesse, with any superstitious <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href="#pb242">242</a>]</span>respect, or with indifferent forbearance to winke at the wickednesse of Idolaters.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 272.]</span>Here the Guardiano offered for ten peeces of gold (although my due be thirty Chickens
sayd he) to make me Knight of the holy Grave, or of the order of Jerusalem, which
I refused, knowing the condition of that detestable oath I behooved to have sworne;
but I saw two of these other Pilgrimes receive that Order of Knighthood.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The Knights of the Holy Grave.</i></span>The manner whereof is thus: First they bind themselves with a solemne vow, to pray
(during life) for the Pope, King of Spaine, and the Duke of Venice, from whom the
Friers receive their maintenance; and also in speciall, for the French King, by whose
meanes they obtaine their liberty of the great Turke, to frequent these monumentall
places. Secondly, they are sworne enemies to Protestants, and others, who will not
acknowledge the superiority of the Romane Church. Thirdly, they must pay yearely some
stipend unto the Order of the Franciscans. These attestations ended, the Frier putteth
a gilded spurre on his right heele, causing the yong made Knight stoope downe on his
knees, and lay his hands on the holy Grave: after this he taketh a broad sword from
under his gray gowne (being privately carried for feare of the Turkes) which is (as
he sayd) the Sword, wherewith victorious Godfrey conquered Jerusalem, and giveth this
new upstart Cavaliero, nine blowes upon the right shoulder. Loe here the fashion of
this Papisticall Knighthood, which I forsooke.
</p>
<p>Indeed upon the Knight-hood they have certaine priviledges among the Papists, of which
these are two: If a malefactor being condemned and brought to the Gallows, any of
these Knights may straight cut the rope and releeve him: The other is, they may carry
and buy silkes through all Spaine and Italy, or elsewhere, and pay no Custome, neither
in comming nor going, nor for any silke ware, where the Romish Church hath any commandement.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 273.]</span>After our Guardiano had ended his superstitious Rites and Ceremonies, upon Easter
day, before midnight, we <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href="#pb243">243</a>]</span>returned to the Monastery, having stayed three dayes within that Church: And the next
day thereafter, the nine Ragusan and Venetian Factors left us, returning backe to
their severall Stations.
</p>
<p>About sixe of the clocke, on monday morning, the Padre Viccario, and the aforesayd
John Baptista accompanying us, we travailed abroad in the hilly Countrey of Judea.
In this dayes journey, the places of any note we saw were these: <span class="marginnote"><i>Certaine relicts of Monuments.</i></span>First, where the Daughters of Jerusalem came foorth to meete Saul, crying, Saul hath
slaine his thousand, and David his ten thousand: And for memory of this standeth a
certayne olde pillar of Marble. Next, the valley of Trebin, where David slew the great
<span class="corr" id="xd29e5807" title="Source: Goliah">Goliath</span>. And for remembrance of that, there are a great heape of stones layd together in
the bottome of the valley, like to the Relickes of an old monument. Thirdly, Bezura,
where Absalom killed his brother Ammon for Thamars sake, whereof nothing but the name
is onely reserved.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Emaus.</i></span>Fourthly, the Castle of Emaus, now altogether ruinated, except only three fire houses
of Moores; in which our Saviour was knowne after his Resurrection, by the two Disciples
in breaking of bread; where now the remanents of that house being vaulted, is turned
over for a shelterage to sheepe; and a soft paved lodging for quivering Goates.
</p>
<p><span class="corr" id="xd29e5816" title="Source: Fiftly">Fifthly</span>, the Valley of Gibeon, where the ray-beaming Sunne stood still, at the voice of Joshua,
from his naturall course. Joshua 10. 12.
</p>
<p>Sixtly, the Toombe or buriall place of Samuel, that <span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 274.]</span>divine Prophet of the Lord: over the which the Moores have a Moskque erected, wherein
we could not enter, but hard by and without it, we found one of the finest Fountaines
in all Judea, and yet not a dwelling house neere unto it by three miles, in regard
of the sassinous and infertile ground about it, the water whereof was exceeding light,
sweete, and pleasant in digestion. Seventhly, the Tombes of the valiant Captaine Judas
Macchabeus, and his Children, whereupon are now onely the ruines of an old Chappell,
which is converted in a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="#pb244">244</a>]</span><span class="marginnote"><i>The buriall place of the Kings and Queenes of Israel.</i></span>hould for Sheepe and Goates: And last of all, the buriall place of the noble Family
of the Kings and Queenes of Israel, or Jerusalem, being neere unto the Citty, and
within a short halfe mile. The entry whereto was so straite, that on our backes we
behoved to slide downe, above ten paces under the ground, with light candles in our
hands.
</p>
<p>In that spacious place we saw twenty foure Chambers hewen out of a Marble Rocke. Each
roome hath a hanging stone doore of a great thicknesse, so artificially done by the
skilfull Art of Masons, that the rarest spirit of tenne thousand cannot know how these
doores have bene made, so to move as they do, being a firme Rocke both below and above;
and the doores have neither iron nor timber-worke about them: but by cunning are made
so to turne, and in that same place where they grew they are squared; yea, and so
exquisitely done, that the most curious Carpenter cannot joyne a peece of boord so
neatly, as these stone doores joyne with the Rocke. In each of these roomes are two
Sepulchers, wherein I saw the bones of some of these dead Princes.
</p>
<p>Thursday, the tenth day of my being at Jerusalem, not reckoning the two dayes we spent
in going to Jordan, the weeke before: We I say, ishued forth of the Citty <span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 275.]</span>earely, with our aforesayd guides, riding Westward: The first remarkeable thing we
saw, was the place (as they say) where the Crosse grew, whereon Christ suffered: being
reserved by Greekes, who have a Convent builded over it: That Crosse is sayd to have
bene of foure sundry kinds of wood, and not of one Tree, for they shewed us but one
hole where it grew, and so they hold it to have bene of one peece of Olive Tree, but
this I suspend, leaving it to be searched, by the pregnancy of riper judgements then
mine, howsoever opinious.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The leying vilany of a Rogish Greeke.</i></span>And here I cannot forget a dissembling knavish Greeke, who came here to London some
eight yeares ago, to beg support for the reparation of this decayed Monastery of the
holy Crosse. Well, Gundamore the Spanish Ambassadour <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245">245</a>]</span>intertained him; and recommended his cause to our politicque power: A contribution
is granted, over all England for the same purpose, and also recoiled, besides the
severall acknowledgements of our Noble Courtiers: Oportunity come, I rancountred with
this counterfeit Rascall in White hall: Whereupon diverse Gentlemen his Majesties
servants, desired me to try him, if he had bene at Jerusalem, or dwelt at the Cloister
of the holy Crosse: presently I demanded him, where the Convent stood, he replied
within Jerusalem, and upon Mount Moriah: which was false, for the Convent is remote
from the Citty, about three English miles: I posed him further about the situation
of Jerusalem, &amp;c. The quantity of this Cloyster, of its Church, of the number of Friers,
who lived in it, with many more questions, whose circumstances would be tedious: To
any one of which, he could not reply, but stood shivering for feare and shame; neither
had he never bene in Asia nor these parts: whereupon stealing out of the Court, he
was no more seene abroad: <span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 276.]</span>for he had got at Court, and in the Kingdome, above twelve hundreth pounds starling,
besides the advancement of the Papists, and Recusants: and here was a tricke, that
then the Spanish faction put upon us and themselves also being deceaved by a deceiver,
deceived us with a double deceit, policy, and lyes.
</p>
<p>About five miles further, we arrived at a Village, on the Mountaine of Judea, where
we saw a disinhabited house, in which Elizabeth the mother of Saint John Baptist dwelt,
when Mary came up from Galilee to salute her; and neare to this, we beheld (as they
say) the Sanctuary, wherein Zacharias was stricken dumbe till Elizabeth was delivered:
Two miles further, on a Rocky Mountaine, <span class="marginnote"><i>Saint John the Baptists Cave.</i></span>we arrived at a Cave, wherein (say they) S. John did his pennance till he was nineteene
yeare of age, after which time, he went downe and dwelt at Jordan: It is a pretty
fine place hewen out of a Rocke, to the which we mounted by twelve steppes, having
a window cut through a great thicknesse of firme stone, whence we had the faire prospect
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246">246</a>]</span>of a fruitfull valley: and from the mouth of this delectable Grotto, gusheth forth
a most delicious Fountaine.
</p>
<p>Returning thence, we passed over an exceeding high Mountaine, from whence we saw the
most part of Judea; and to the Westward, in the way of Egypt, the Castle of the Prophet
Elisha, and Idumea the Edomits land, lying also betweene Egypt and Jerusalem: This
cloudy height, is called the mountaine of Judea, because it over-toppeth all the rest
of the mountaines, that circumviron Jerusalem, Palestine, Galilee, Phenicia, or Samaria.
Descending on the South side of the same Hill, we arrived at Phillips Fountaine, in
which he baptized the Eunuch of Æthiopia, standing full in the way of Gaza. Here <span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 277.]</span>we paid some certaine Madins unto the Moores of the Village, for accoasting the place,
and drinking of the water: So did we also for the sight of every speciall Monument
in Judea.
</p>
<p>At night, we lodged in Bethleem, in a Monasterie of the same Fransciscans of Jerusalem,
being onely sixe Friers: After Supper we went all of us (having Candles) to the place,
where our Saviour was borne; over the which, there is a magnificent Church builded:
yea, the most large and royall workmanship that for a Church is in all Asia, or Affricke,
being decored with a hundred and fifty Pillars. But before we came where the Crub
had beene, we passed certaine difficile wayes; where, being arrived, wee entered in
a gorgeous roome, adorned with Marble, Saphyre, and Alabaster stones; and there they
shewed us <span class="marginnote"><i>Christs Crub at Bethleem.</i></span>both the place and the resemblance of the Crub: over which were hanging lampes of
pure Gold, and within their circles oyle continually burning. Not farre from that
place, and within the body of the admirable Church, they shewed us the part, over
the which the Starre stayed, that conducted the three Wise-men from the East, who
came out of Chaldea, to worship Christ, and presented gifts unto him. From thence
they brought us to a Cave without the Towne, wherein (say they) the Virgin Mary was
hid, when Herod persecuted the Babes life, (from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247">247</a>]</span>which also being warned by the Angell) She and Joseph fled downe into Ægypt with the
Child.
</p>
<p>In this time of her feare, say they, the milke left her blessed breasts, so that the
Babe was almost starved, but Shee praying to the Almighty, there came forthwith abundance,
which overflowing her breasts, and falling to <span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 278.]</span>the ground, left ever since, as they alledge, this consequent vertue to this Cave.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Admirable dust.</i></span>The earth of the Cave is white as Snow, and hath this miraculous operation, that a
little of it drunke in any Liquor, to a Woman, that after her Child-birth is barren
of Milke, shall forthwith give abundance: which is not onely availeable to Christians,
but likewise to Turkish, Moorish, and Arabianish Women, who will come from farre Countries,
to fetch of this Earth. I have seene the nature of this dust practised, wherefore
I may boldly affirme it, to have the force of a strange vertue: Of the which earth
I brought with me a pound weight, and presented the halfe of it to our sometimes Gracious
Queene Anne of blessed memory, with divers other rare relicts also, as a Girdle, and
a paire of Garters of the Holy Grave, all richly wrought in silke and gold, having
this inscription at every end of them in golden letters, Sancto Sepulchro, and the
word Jerusalem, &amp;c.
</p>
<p>Wednesday following, wee hired foure and twenty Moores to conduct us unto <span class="marginnote"><i>Salomons Fish-ponds.</i></span>Salomons Fish-ponds, which are onely three, being never a whit decayed; and to Fons
Segnatus, whence commeth the water in a stone-Conduit, along the Mountaines, that
serveth Jerusalem, which worke was done by Salomon. The Ponds being hewne out, and
made square from the devalling face of a precipitating mountaine; through which the
streame of Fons Signatus runneth, filling the Ponds till it come to its owne aquadotte.
</p>
<p>Returning thence, and keeping our way Southward, we passed through the valley of Hebron,
where Jacob dwelt, and entered into the fields of Sychem, where Jacobs Sonnes kept
their fathers Sheepe; and not far hence, they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248">248</a>]</span><span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 279.]</span>shewed us a dry Pit, which they called Josephs Pit, that was at Dothan; wherein he
was put by his Brethren, before they sold him to the Ismaelites.
</p>
<p>In our backe comming to Bethleem, we saw a Cave in the Desart of Ziph, wherein David
hid himselfe, when he was persecuted by King Saul; and the field Adra, where the Angels
brought the glad tidings of salvation unto the Sheepheards. Unto all which parts our
Moorish guard and John Baptista, brought us and conducted us backe againe to Bethleem,
where we stayed the second night.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The Towne of Bethleem.</i></span>Bethleem is the pleasantest Village in all Judea, situated on a pretty Hill, and five
English miles from Jerusalem: It produceth commodiously, an infinite number of Olive
and Figge-trees, some Cornes, and a kinde of white Wine, wherewith we were furnished
all the time of our abode there; also in, and about Jerusalem. In our way, as we came
backe to the City, the next day following, the Viccario shewed us a little Moskee,
kept by Turkes, in which (sayd hee) was the Tombe of Rachel, Jacobs wife, who died
in that place; as shee was travelling from Padan Aram, with her husband Jacob.
</p>
<p>The ruines also of a house, where Habacuk the Prophet dwelt; a Turpentine tree growing
yet by the way side, under the which (say they) the Virgin Mary was wont to repose
her selfe in travelling. We saw also a naturall rocke in the high way; whereon (say
they) Elias oft slept, and is not ashamed to say, that the hollow dimples of the stone,
was onely made by the impression of his body; as though the tender flesh of man could
leave the print of his portraiture on a hard stone. And not farre from this, they
shewed us the place, where the Starre appeared to the wise men, after they had left
Herod to seeke for the Saviour of mankind.
</p>
<p>Approaching Mount Sion, we saw a quadrangled dry <span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 280.]</span>pond; wherein (say they) Beersheba the Wife of Urias, was Washing, when David looked
forth from the toppe of his Pallace, gazing on the aspect of his lust, gave the Bridle
of reason, fast tyed in the hands of temptation; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249">249</a>]</span>and becomming subject to the subtilty of sinne, was bewitched by her beauty; wherewith
corruption triumphed in Nature, and godlinesse decreased in voluntary consent; and
from a royall Prophet fell in the bloody lists of Murther and Adultery.
</p>
<p>Over against this place, on the North side of Gehinnon, <span class="marginnote"><i>King Davids pallace.</i></span>we saw the ruines of a Palace wherein David dwelt, which hath beene one of the Angles
of the ancient Citty; and standeth at the division of the valley Ennon, which compassed
(as a Ditch) the North part of mount Syon, even to the valley Jehosophat, and so Eastward,
being now filled up with fragments of old walles; and the valley of Gehinnon lying
West, and East; bordering along the South side of Sion, till it joyne also with the
narrow valley of Jehosophat, which invironeth the East, and devalling parts of Jerusalem.
Neere to this demolished Tower, we saw the habitation of Simeon, who having seene
the blessed Messias, sayd: Now Lord let thy Servant depart in peace, for mine eyes
have seene thy Salvation.
</p>
<p>And now lastly uppon the twelfth day of my abode there, early on Thursday morning,
the Guardiano, twelve Friers, and John Baptista (because that was the last day of
seeing any more Monuments, or was to be seene there) accompanied us: as wee issued
at the South-gate of the City, we came to a place, on the skirt of Syon, where (say
they) Peter after his deniall of Christ his maister, wept bitterly.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 281.]</span>Descending by the side of that same Hill, we crossed the valley Gehinnon, <span class="marginnote"><i>Acaldema.</i></span>and came to Acaldema, the Potters field, or field of blood; which is a little foure-squared
Roome, oppositive to the devalling side of the South-falling Syon: three parts whereof
are invironed with a natural rocke, and the fourth square bordering with the valley,
is made up of stone worke: The top is covered, and hath three holes, where through
they let the dead Christians fall downe; for it is a buriall place of Pilgrimes to
this day. As I looked downe, I beheld a great number of dead corpes; some whereof
had white winding sheets, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250">250</a>]</span>and newly dead, lying one above another in a lumpe; yeelded a pestilent smell, by
reason they were not covered with earth, save onely the architecture of a high vault,
which maketh that in a long time the corpes cannot putrifie and rot.
</p>
<p>Neare unto this Campo, we entred into a darke Cave, where (say they) the Apostles
hid themselves, when Christ was taken. At the foote of the same valley, we came to
<span class="marginnote"><i>Ponto Nehemia.</i></span>Ponto Nehemia, in which place the Jewes did hide the Holy Fire, when they were taken
captives to Babylon; walking more downeward, toward the valley of Jehosophat, we saw
a darke Celler under the ground without windowes; wherein (said the Guardian) the
Idolatrous Jewes made a sacrifice of their children unto a brazen Image called Moloch,
which being made hot, they inclosed them in the hollownesse thereof, and so slew them:
and least their crying should have moved any compassion towards them, they made a
thundring noise with drums, and other instruments, whereupon the place was called
Tophet, mentioned in Jer. 7. 31. Hence we came to the Poole of Siloam, in which wee
washed our selves, the water whereof falleth downe through a Rocke, from <span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 282.]</span>the City above, running straight to the valley of Jehosophat; and there we saw also
the remnant of that sacked Towre of Siloam. Neare to this we saw a fountaine, where
(say they) the Virgin Mary used oft to wash the Babes clothes and linnen clouts. From
thence we crossed the <span class="marginnote"><i>Brook Cedron.</i></span>Brooke Cedron (which guttereth through the valley of Jehosophat) and is alwaies dry,
unlesse it be in December, when the raine falleth there impetuously for a month together,
which is all the winter they have in these parts: during which time none may labour,
nor travell, but forced to keepe themselves within houses: Having past I say this
Brooke wee came to the Tombes of Absolon and Zacharias, and the Cave wherein S. James
was wont to hide himselfe from the persecuting Jewes. Ascending more upward on the
hill, in the way of Bithania, wee saw these places, where Judas hanged himselfe, over
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251">251</a>]</span>which there is a vault erected, like a halfe Moone, in memory of his selfe murther,
and hard by they shewed us where the withered Figge tree grew, the place being inclosed
within a high stone dyke; and halfe a mile thence we came to the ruined house of Simon
the Lepar.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Lazarus Tomb in Bethania.</i></span>Arriving at Bithania, we saw the Castle and Tombe of Lazarus, on whom Christ shewed
a miracle, in raising him from the grave, after hee had beene 4. dayes dead. It is
a singular and rare Alabaster Tombe, and so exquisitely done, that it excelleth (Jerusalem
excepted) all the monuments in Judea, erected for the like purpose, being inclosed
within a delicate Chappell under the ground. Not farre thence in the same Village,
wee saw the decayed house where Martha, and Mary Magdalen inhabited, and the stone
whereon Christ sate (say they) when he sayd to Martha, Mary hath chosen the best part.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 283.]</span>Leaving this moorish Bithania, being now a Village of no qualitie, we returned by
beggerly Bethphage, and finding it farre worser, about mid-day wee arrived on the
top of Mount Olivet, where wee dined on our owne provision carried with us, and then
proceeded in our sights.
</p>
<p>From this place wee had the full prospect of Jerusalem: For the City standing upon
the edge of a hill, can not be seene all at one sight; save on this Mountaine, which
is two times higher then Mount Sion. These are the Monuments shewne us upon the <span class="marginnote"><i>Mount Olivet and the Places of note thereof.</i></span>Mount of Olives: First, the print of the left foote of our Saviour, in an immoveable
stone, which he made when he ascended to Heaven; the Guardiano told us further, that
the right footes print was taken away by the Turkes; and detained by them in the Temple
of Salomon: But who can thinke our Saviour trode so hard at his ascention, as to have
left the impression of his feete behind him.
</p>
<p>Next the place where hee foretold the judgement to come, and the signes, and the wonders,
that should be seene in the Heavens before that dreadfull day. Thirdly, the place
where the Symbolum Apostolorum was made, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252">252</a>]</span>which is a fine chamber under the ground, like a Church, having twelve pillars to
support it. Fourthly, where Christ taught his Disciples the Pater noster, and where
he fell in an agony, when hee sweat blood and water. Fifthly, where Peter, James,
and John slept, whiles our Saviour prayed, and returned so oft to awake them; and
also below that, where the other Disciples were left. Sixtly, the Garden of Gethsemane,
where Christ used commonly to pray; in the which place he was apprehended by the officers
of the high Priests, and it was also where Judas kissed him, and the Sergeants fell
backward on the <span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 284.]</span>ground. Seventhly, they shewed us a stone marked with the Head, Feete, and Elbowes
of Jesus, in their throwing of him downe, when as they bound him, after hee was taken,
and ever since (say they) have these prints remained there.
</p>
<p>And lastly, at the foote of mount Olivet, in the valley of Jehosophat, we descended
by a paire of staires of forty three steppes, and sixe paces large, in a faire Church
builded under the ground: Where (say they) the Monument of the Assumption of the Virgin
Mary is, and did show it unto us, whom (they thinke) was borne in Jerusalem, dwelt
at Bethleem, and Nazareth, and dyed uppon mount Syon. <span class="marginnote"><i>Sacred and singular Tombes.</i></span>I saw also there, the Sepulchers of Joseph her husband, Joachim her Father, and of
Anna her mother. And for which sights paying sixteene Madins a man, to certaine Moores:
we returned to our Monastery againe night to repose us, having seene all the Antiquities
and places of note, were to be seene, in, and about all Judea.

</div><p>
</p>
<p>Loe, I have plainely described all these Monuments, by the order of these twelve severall
dayes: The like heretofore, was never by a Travailer so punctually, so truly, and
so curiously set downe, and made manifest to the intellective Reader. But as I sayd
in the beginning of my Description, so say I now also at the Conclusion, some of these
things are Rediculous, some of manifest untruths, some also doubtfull, and others,
somewhat more credible, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href="#pb253">253</a>]</span>and of apparent truth. The recapitulation whereof, is only by me used, as I was informed,
by Gaudentius Saybantus the father Guardian, Laurenzo Antonio il Viccario, and the
Trenchman John Baptista.
</p>
<p>Now in Jerusalem, wee eleaven Frankes stayed three <span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 285.]</span>dayes longer, preparing our selves for a new Voyage to go downe to Egypt with a Caravan
of Grand Cayro: In which time the aforesaid Frier Laurenzo, whose life I had saved
on the Quarantanam, propined me privatly with twelve Crosses made of the Olive Wood
of mount Olivet: Each Crosse having 24. Relickes indented in them, with fourty paire
of Chaplets made of that same Wood, two Turkish Handkerchiefes, and three paire of
Garters and Girdles of the Holy Grave: All wrought in silke and Gold, with diverse
other things, &amp;c. Which were not so thankfully received, as they were thankfully given,
by a gratefull and unforgetfull Frier. Meanewhile, the last day of our staying there,
we went all of us Friers and Pilgrimes in againe to the Holy Grave, where we remained
al night. Earely on the morrow there came a fellow to us, one Elias Areacheros, a
Christian inhabitour at Bethleem, and purveier for the Friers; who did ingrave on
<span class="marginnote"><i>The Armes of Jerusalem.</i></span>our severall Armes upon Christs Sepulcher the name of Jesus, and the Holy Crosse;
beeing our owne option, and desire: and heere is the Modell thereof. But I, decyphered,
and subjoyned below mine, the four incorporate <span class="marginnote"><i>King James his foure Crownes.</i></span>Crowns of King James, with this Inscription, in the lower circle of the Crowne, Vivat
Jacobus Rex: <span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 286.]</span>returning to the fellow two Piasters for his reward: I fixt these lines for King James.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">

</div>
<p class="first">Which when the Guardian understood, what I had done <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href="#pb254">254</a>]</span>in memory of my Prince upon that Sacred Tombe, hee was greatly offended with me, that
I should have polluted that Holy place, with the name of such an Arch-enemy to the
Romane Church. But not knowing how to mend himselfe, and hearing me to recite of the
Heroick Vertues of our matchlesse Monarch: who for Bounty, Wisedome, and Learning,
was not paragonized among all the Princes of the earth: His fury fell; and begun to
intreate me, to make it knowne to his Majesty, that hee never allowed any support
to their afflicted lives, neyther any gratuity for maintayning of those Sacred Monuments
at Jerusalem, his subjects being as free here as they. Which indeed I performed, for
after my arrivall in England, and having propined his Majesty with diverse rare things,
and a Turpentine rod from Jordan; in the midst of my Discourses, I told his Highnesse,
in the Privy Garden of Greenewich, the Guardians request. Who indeed gave me a most
gracious answere, saying, They never sought any helpe of him, and if they had, he
would have supported their necessity. Bidding farewell to the Church of St. Salvatore,
and being re incloystred againe, after breakfast, the reckoning of Stridor Dentium
came to us, <span class="marginnote"><i>Of English money.</i></span>for 17. dayes diet, being to each man six shillings a day, amounting for my part to
5 pounds two shillings. Then the Guardians Secretary, presented me my Patent under
<span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 287.]</span>their Great Seale; &amp; that cost me 3. Chickens of Gold. The beginning whereof I recall,
although the principall, <span class="marginnote"><i>The Discourse of the Seale is in the page following.</i></span>be lost in the Inquisition of Malaga, was thus: <span lang="la">Frater Gaudentius Saybantus ordinis minorum regularis observantiæ Sancti Antonii Dei
&amp; Apostolicæ sedis gratia, Sacri montis Sion Guardianus, Terræ sanctæ gubernator &amp;
custos; ac in partibus orientis Apostolicus Commissarius, <span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 288.]</span>salutem in Domino sempiternam. Notum vobis facimus, &amp;c.</span> The Contents whereof, reciting all the memorable things I saw within the Holy Land,
there was thereunto annexed their Great Seale, sticking fast, or locked in upon the
lower face of the Parchment, the impression whereof, had the Effigies of the twelve
Apostles, and Christ in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href="#pb255">255</a>]</span>the midst: having this Circumscription about: <span lang="la">Magnum sigillum Sacri montis Sion Guardianus</span>. The model whereof is affixed in the former page.
</p>
<div class="figure p254width" id="p254"><img src="images/p254.png" alt="The Model of the Great Seale of the Guardians of the Holy Grave" width="653" height="719"><p class="figureHead">The Model of the Great Seale of the Guardians of the Holy Grave</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>Then had we avaricious Baptista our Guide and Interpreter to reward, every one of
us propining him with two Chickens of gold: And lastly wee gratified the gaping Steward,
the Cerberian Porter, the Cymerian Cooke, and his Ætnean face, with a Chicken of gold
the man, from each of us: amounting in all among the foure Catzocullioni, to twenty
foure pounds fifteene shillings sterling.
</p>
<p>Nay this was not all; for even when the Ægyptian Caravan, was staying for us without
the City, the Guardian <span class="marginnote"><i>Greedy and flattering Friers.</i></span>made a begging Sermon to us, imploring our bounties to commiserate and support their
great calamities, losses, and oppressions inflicted upon them by the Infidels, with
many other base &amp; flattering speeches: which indeed nine of us refused, because of
the great Extortion he had imposed uppon us before; but the two Germane Barons gave
him the value of sixe English pounds, or there abouts.
</p>
<p>And now finally, or I leave mount Syon, I thinke it not amisse, to give the itching
Travailer a frozen stomacke, who perhaps soweth Words in the Wind, conceptions in
the Ayre, and catcheth Salmond swimming on Atlas: I will now (I say) justly cast up
to him the charges I defrayed <span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 289.]</span>within the Wals of Jerusalem, not reckoning my journall expences and tributs else
where abroad; arising to eighteene pounds sixteene shillings starling: And there a
cooling card for his Caprizziat, and imaginary inventions: And it may serve also,
to damnifie the blind conceit of many who thinke that Travellers are at no charges,
goe where they will, but are freely maintained every where; and that is as false,
as an hereticall errour. May the twelfth, and the eighteene day of my staying there,
about mid-day, the other ten and I joyned with the Caravan, who formerly had conditioned
with us to carry us to Ægypt, and to furnish the rest Camels or Dromidories to ride
upon, (for I would never ride any) for nineteene <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256">256</a>]</span>Piasters the man, discharging us also all tributes and Caffars were to be imposed
upon us by the way; and so we marched through the South-west part of Judea towards
Idumea, or the Edomits land; and meane-while I gave <span class="marginnote"><i>The Authors good night to Jerusalem.</i></span>Jerusalem this goodnight, &amp;c.

<p class="first">Having bid farewell to Syon, we marched that afternoone in the way of Gaza; and arrived
at night in a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href="#pb257">257</a>]</span><span class="marginnote"><i>Kind Jewes to us Franks.</i></span>goodly Village, more full of Jewes than Moores, called Hembaluda, situate on the face
of a fruitfull hill, and the last limit of Judea: Here the Germanes and I were well
intertained gratis, by certaine Jewes that spoke Italian, and much rejoyced to see
such strangers in these bounds, for two of them had beene borne in Venice: The Captaine,
and our company were all Ægyptians, all of them being Christians, called Copties,
viz. beleevers: Their number was about eight hundred persons, who had come up from
Ægypt, to dignify for devotions sake this Easter time, being the great feast of Jerusalem;
Of whom by the way we received great affability &amp; kind respect without any offence.
</p>
<p>That night the whole Caravan lay in the fields, and we stayed within the Towne making
merry with our Hebraick friends, earely the next morning wee imbraced our Idumean
way, finding this Edomitish land sorely <span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 291.]</span>distressed by the Arabs, and yet the Inhabitants were subject to the Turke: In this
long dayes journey we found abundance of water, and all other necessaries for our
reliefe, and yet the people were both rude &amp; extreame barbarous, having no more show
of humanity then the foure footed Leopards of Berdoa.
</p>
<p>The Dutch Gentlemen grew affrayed at these savages, as being unacquainted before with
such an awful sight; and to dispell their feare, tush sayd I, courage Gentlemen, no
scope, no hope, and flashd over these lines in Italian to them;

</div>
<p class="first"><span class="marginnote"><i>The auncient City of Gaza.</i></span>Againe night we declined towards Gaza, and there stayed in a fine Cane prepared for
Travellers; where the whole Caravan, Souldiers, Camels, Dromodores, Mules, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258">258</a>]</span>and Asses were all well satisfied and refreshed: The next morning we went to the Bezestan
or market place, and there furnished our selves with provision of Bread, Hens, Egges,
Garlicke, and Onions, sufficient enough to carry us through the desarts being ten
dayes journey. Gaza now is called Habalello, and is composed of twelve hundred fire-houses,
and sensible against the incursions of Arabs: The ruvid Cittizens, being Turkes, Moores,
Jews, domeseticke Arabians, with a few Georgians, &amp; Nostranes.
</p>
<p>There is a Garrison here of Souldiers, and a Turkish Captaine, that commandeth the
Towne and Castle: In <span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 292.]</span>the afternoone, we set our faces forward to that fearefull Wildernesse, and travailed
or night twelve miles, pitching our Tents beside a source or standing Well. Here our
Guard, kept a strict Watch about us all night; and I kept as well the Germanes from
langour, cherishing them with joviall merriments, for they were my inward friends,
yet of a faint and fearefull nature. At the breach of day we set forward, passing
through diverse Rockey and shrubby heights, till afternoone, and then wee declined
to a sandy valley: Where when come, what with the deepnesse <span class="marginnote"><i>Burning Sands.</i></span>of the Way, and the great heate reflexing upon the sand, and from the Sand to our
faces, we were miserably turmoiled, especially I, who went alwayes on foote.
</p>
<p>Having past this wearisome bottome, and before night marching along the skirt of a
craggy Hill, two hundred Arabs broake out upon us from holes and bushes, and shrewdly
annoyed our Company with Arrowes, till a contribution of sixteene Piasters was sent
to them. The halfe of that night we pitched our Tents, in a pastorable <span class="marginnote"><i>Wild Arabs selling water.</i></span>plaine, where some scattering Arabs, sold us Water in Wooden Cups, carrying it in
Wilde Boare skins upon their naked backes. Two of which Savages our Captayne hyred,
to guide us the next day to the first Castle of the three, that were built by the
Turkes, and a dayes journey distant one from another; beeing each of them strongly
guarded with Souldiers, and that for the reliefe of Caravans, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href="#pb259">259</a>]</span>being the most dangerous, and most desolate place in the Desarts.
</p>
<p>Our Guides the day following, brought us through the best and safest places of the
Country, where we found certayne profitable parts, planted with haire-cloath tents,
and over-cled heere and there with spots of Sheepe and Goates: and yet were we not
there without the invasion of stragling Arabs, and paying of tributes, which the <span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 293.]</span>Captaine defrayed for us, our condition being formerly made so at Jerusalem. Before
night with great heat, and greater drouth, we approached to the first Castle, where
the Captayne thereof received us kindly, causing our Tents to be pitched round about
the Quadrangled Tower. Here we had abundance of Water (though I would rather have
had Wine) to suffice the whole Company, drawne out of a Cisterne, and reposing safely
uppon the hard ground, the Castle Garrison watched us, and our guard watched them.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Grievous and desertuous travelling.</i></span>Thence with a new Guide the sequell morne, we marched through a fiery faced plaine,
scorch&#x2019;d with burning heate, and deepe rolling Sand, where diverse of our smallest
Beasts perished, with sixe men and Women also in relieving their overwhelmed Asses.
Long or midday, having got to a hard height, we pitched our Tents, reposing under
their shaddowes till the evening, for wee were not able to indure the intollerable
heate of the Sun; and so did wee likewise over-umbrate our selves every mid-day. The
vigour of the day gone, and the cooling night come, we advanced forward to the middle
Castle, being led by our Guide, and the pale Lady of the night leading him: Where
when come, wee found neyther that Fort answerable to the former in strength, nor the
Captaine so humane as the other was: Here wee were all offended with the scarcity
of Water, the Captayne playing the Villaine, crossed us, because the Caravanship were
Christians; at last about mid-night some 30. Arabs, came to us loaden with Water,
carried on their backes. To whom we payed for every Caraff, beeing an English <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260">260</a>]</span>quart, three Aspers of silver, ten Aspers going to a shilling: Whereof my kinde Dutch-men
drunke too <span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 294.]</span>much, the Water being thicke and of a brounish colour; and hot like pisse, offended
their over-wained stomackes; which as I supposed, was the chiefest cause the next
day of some of their Deaths.
</p>
<p>After mid-night, the Turkish Captaine, and our Caravan fell at variance, about Water
to our Beasts, who were ready to choake, and if they had not bin prevented with Souldiers
on both sides, it had drawne us and them, to a finall mischiefe. The discord unpacified,
before the following day, and within night, we imbraced our wilsome and fastidious
Way, journying through many dens, and umbragious Caves, over-shaded with mouldring
heights; <span class="marginnote"><i>Savage women having their Child-bed in Caves.</i></span>in some whereof we found Savage Women lying in their Barbarous child-bed: having their
bodies naked (the fore-face of their Wombe excepted) their beds were made of soft
Sand, and over-spread with leaves a foote thicke; whose new borne Babes lying in their
armes, were swadled with the same Leaves. And for all their sicknesse, which was very
small, they had none of our Wives sugred sops, burnt Wines, Venison pasties, Delicate
fare, and great Feasting, nor a moneths lying in, and then Churched, putting their
husbands to incompatible charges. No, no, their food is onely Bread, Garlicke, Hearbes,
and Water, and on the third or fourth day, in stead of their Churching, they goe with
Bowes and Arrowes to the fieldes againe, hunting for spoiles and booties from passing
Caravans.
</p>
<p>Advancing in our course, we fell downe from the hils in a long bottome of Sand, above
sixe miles in length: Wherein with sore Wrestling agaynst the parching Sun, and could
get no ground to pitch our Tents to over shade us; three of our Germans, the two Barons,
Signior Strouse, and Signior Crushen, with one Signior Thomasio, <span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 295.]</span>tumbled downe from their beasts backes starke dead, being <span class="marginnote"><i>The death of three Germane Gentlemen.</i></span>suffocated with the vigorous Sunne, for it was in May, choaked also with extreame
drouth, and the reflection of the burning sand; and besides their faire was growne
miserable, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href="#pb261">261</a>]</span>and their Water worse, for they had never beene acquainted with the like distresse
before, though it was alwayes my vade Mecum. Whereupon the Caravan staied and caused
cast on their Corpes againe, on their owne beasts backes, and carrying them to the
side of a hard Hill, we digged a hollow pit, and disspoyling them of their Turkish
cloathes, I did with my owne hands cast them all three one above another, in that
same hole, and covering the Corpes with mouldring earth, the Souldiers helped me to
role heavy stones above their grave, to the end, that the bloody Jackals should not
devoure their corpes; and to conclude this woefull and sorrowfull accident, the other
Germanes alive bestowed on me their dead friends Turkish garments, because of my love
and diligent care I ever did show them; which one of their empty Mules carried for
me to Grand Cairo.
</p>
<p>Whence with diverse assaults, and greater paines, accoasting <span class="marginnote"><i>The third Castle of the desarts.</i></span>the third Castle, with as great bewailing the losse of our friends, as we had contentment
in our owne safety, we found this third Captayne both humane and hospitable: Who indeede
himselfe in person with his Garrison, watched us all night, and had a speciall care
in providing Water for us all, propining our Captayne and us eight Frankes before
supper, with three roasted Hens, and two Capons: This Turkish Captayne told us there
were three inhabited Townes in these Desarts, the chiefest whereof was Sehan, situate
on the Red Sea, having a harbor and shipping, that Trade both to Ægypt and Æthiopia,
whose commodities are silken stuffes and Spices <span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 296.]</span>which they transport from Meccha, and carrie to Melinda, and the afore-sayd places
in Affricke: But now least I sinke in Prolixity, discoursing of sinking Sands, and
make good the Italian Proverbe, Chi troppo abbracio, nulla stringe, viz. That he who
would imbrace too much, can hold nothing fast. I decist from this Journall proceeding,
and punctuall Discourse of my laborious Pen, wherein, notwithstanding the Reader (I
having layd open more than halfe of the Wildernesse) may (like that learned Geometrician,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href="#pb262">262</a>]</span>who finding the length of Hercules foote on the Hill Olympus, drew forth the portraicture
of his whole body thereby) easily conjecture by the former Relation, the sequell sight
of these Desartuous places; and therefore the rest, I will onely Epitomize in generall
till mine arrivall at Saleack on the Confines of Ægypt.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The bounds of the three <span class="corr" id="xd29e6225" title="Source: Arabians">Arabias</span>.</i></span>Arabia is bounded on the West, with the Red Sea, and the Ægyptian Istmus: On the North
with Canaan, Mesopotamia, and a part of Syria: On the East with the Persian gulfe,
Caldea, and Assiria: On the South with the great Ocean, and Indian Sea: This Countrey
lyeth from the East to the West, in length about 900. and some 3500. miles in compasse.
The people generally are addicted to Theft, Rapine, and Robberies: hating all Sciences
Mechanicall or Civill, they are commonly all of the second Stature, swift on foote,
scelerate, and seditious, boysterous in speech, of colour Tauny, boasting much of
their triball Antiquity, and noble Gentry: Notwithstanding their garments be borne
with them from the bare Belly, their food also semblable, to their ruvid condition,
and as savagiously tame (I protest) as the foure footed Citizens of Lybia: They are
not valourous, nor desperate in <span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 297.]</span>assaults without great advantage, for a 100. Turkes is truely esteemed to be sufficient
enough to incounter 300. Arabs. Their language extendeth it selfe farre both in Asia,
and Affricke, in the former, through Palestine, Syria, Mesopotamia, Cilicia, even
to the Mount Caucasus: In the latter, through Ægypt, Libia, and all the Kingdomes
of Barbary even to Morocco.
</p>
<p>This Arabia deserta, is the place where the people of Israel wandred forty yeares
long, being fed with Manna from Heaven, and with water out of the driest rocks: In
which is Mount Sinai, where the Law of the two <span class="marginnote"><i>The scurrile Arabian Desarts.</i></span>Tables was promulgated. The most part of these Desarts is neither fit for herbage
nor tillage, being covered over with a dry, and a thicke Sand, which the wind transporteth
whither it listeth, in heapes and mountaines, that often intercept and indanger fatigated
Travellers. The Inhabitants <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263">263</a>]</span>here are few, so are their Cities, their dwellings being in sequestrate dennes and
haire-cloath Tents: The most of their wealth consisteth in Camels Dromidories, and
Goats.
</p>
<p>Before our arrivall in Saleak, we passed the little Istmus of ground which parteth
Asia, and Affrica, disjoyning the Mediterranean and the red Seas: Divers have attempted
to digge through this strait to make both Seas meete for a nearer passage to India,
of whom Sesostris King of Ægypt was the first: Secondly, Darius the great Persian
Monarch: Thirdly, another Ægyptian King, who drew a ditch 100. foote broad, and 30.
and odde miles long. But when he intended to finish it, he was forced to cease, for
feare of overflowing all the lower land, the red Sea being found to be higher by three
cubits than the ordinary plaine of Ægypt: Yet howsoever it was, the ditch is hollow
in divers parts, and fastidious, because of sands to passe over.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 298.]</span>At Saleack we overtooke a great Caravan of two thousand people, and twelve hundred
Camels and Dromidores, which were loaden with the ware of Aleppo, and come from Damascus,
intending their voyage for Cayro, whose company we subtilly left, &amp; marchd before
them, for receiving of water by the way for our selves, and beasts out of Cisternes,
which we left dry behind us.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The nature of Camels and Dromidores.</i></span>A Dromidore, and Camel differ much in quality, but not in quantity, being of one height,
bredth, and length; save only their heads and feete, which are proportionated alike;
and the difference is such, that the Dromidory hath a quicke and hard-reaching trot,
and will ride above 80. miles in the day, if that his rider can indure the paine.
But the Camell is of a contrary disposition: For he hath a most slow and lazy pace,
removing the one foote from the other, as though he were weighing his feete in a ballance;
neither can he goe faster although he would: But he is a great deale more tractable
then the other: For when his maister loadeth him, he falleth downe on his knees to
the ground, and then riseth againe with his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264">264</a>]</span>burthen, which will be marvailous great, sometimes 600. or 800. weight.
</p>
<p>The red Sea, which we left to the Westward of us, and our left hand is not red, as
many suppose, but is the very colour of other Seas: The reason for which it hath beene
called Mare rubrum, is only because of the bankes, rushes, sands &amp; bushes that grow
by the shore side, which are naturally red. Some others have called it so, in respect
of the Brookes, which Moses turned to red blood, who misconstruing the true sense,
tooke Seas, for Rivers.
</p>
<p>It is vulgarly tearmed Sinus Arabicus, whose length is 1600. miles. This Sea is famous
for the miraculous passage of the Israelites through it, and the drowning of <span class="right-marginnote">[VI. 299.]</span>Pharaoh and his people: and because of Spices that were brought from India and Arabia
to Alexandria, from whence the Venetians dispersed the same through all Europe and
the Mediterren coasts of Asia and Affrick: But this Navigation is now discontinued
by the Portugals, English, and Dutch; which bring such Wares to their severall homes
by the backe side of Affricke: So that the Trafficke <span class="marginnote"><i>Indian Spices much weakned.</i></span>of Alexandria is almost decayed, and the Riches of the Venetians much diminished;
so is the vertue of the Spices much impayred by too much moisture contracted, with
the long and tedious carriage thereof.
</p>
<p>This afore-sayd Saleack, is thought to be seated on the lower and Eastmost end of
Gozan, consisting of eight hundred dwelling Houses, being Walled and fensible against
the Arabs, and defended also with a Castle, and ten troupes of Horse-men being Janizaries.
Here we rested and refreshed our selves two nights, providing us fresh victuals for
Grand-Cairo, being foure dayes journey distant; and at our leaving of Saleack, I saluted
this new seene Countrey, with a greedy conceit of more curiosities.

wee reincountred with infinite Villages on both hands, and in our high Way; all builded
upon artificiall Channels <span class="right-marginnote">[VII. 301.]</span>drawne from Nylus; and these Fabrickes, onely made up of Wood or Bricke, being one
or two Stories high. The Captaine, in diverse parts at our mid-dayes reposing, was
constrayned to buy water from the Egyptians, to satisfie the Company: yea, and that
same night, the first of foure, or we came to Cayre, at the Village of Bianstare,
he payed five Sultans of gold for Watering all us and the Beasts, amounting to thirty
five shillings sterling.
</p>
<p>The next day journying towards a goodly Towne, named Saliabsteck, we travailed through
a fruitful planure, fraught full of fruite Trees, and abounding in Wheate, <span class="marginnote"><i>Two seasons of riping graine in Egypt.</i></span>Rye, and Barley, being new cut downe, May 14. For this was their first Harvest, the
Land yeelding twice a yeare Cornes; and the latter, is in our December recoiled. This
Land hath as it were a continuall Summer, and notwithstanding of the burning heate,
it produceth alwayes abundance of Fruites and Hearbes for all the Seasons of the yeare:
So that the whole Kingdome is but a Garden, having ever one Fruite ready to be plucked
downe, and another comming forwards; or like to the best sort of Lemmon Trees, that
as some Reape, some are growing greene, others budding forth, and some still in the
floorish: Even so is the beauty and fertility of all the lower Ægypt; which although
the Country be not often troubled with Raine, yet the rank serene or dew of the night,
in the Summer, refresheth all kindes of growing things: betweene Saliabsteck, and
Cayre, being two dayes journey: We Francks, bad farwell to water, and drunke daily
of Coffa, made of a seed Coave, which being taken hot, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="#pb267">267</a>]</span>is ever kept boyling within Fornaces in earthen pots, it expelleth the crudity of
fruites and hearbes so much there frequented.
</p>
<p>Arriving at last in this little World, the great Cairo, <span class="right-marginnote">[VII. 302.]</span>and bidding farewell to our Caravan, the three Germanes and I, lodged with one Signior
Marco Antonio, a Consul, there for Venice; the other foure French men, going to their
owne Consul, a Marseilian borne and there stayed. Here with this Venetian for three
dayes, the Dutch men and I had great cheare, but they far greater a dayly swallowing
downe of strong Cyprus Wine, without mixture of water; which still I intreated them
to forbeare, but they would not be requested. The season being cruell hot, and their
stomacks surfeited with burning wine, upon the fourth day long or noone, <span class="marginnote"><i>The last three Germanes death in Cayre.</i></span>the three Dutch men were all dead; and yet me thought they had no sicknesse, the red
of their faces staying pleasant, their eyes staring alwayes on mine, and their tongues
were perfit even to the last of their breath.
</p>
<p>He who dyed last, and lived longest, was William Dierganck, who left me all his owne
gold, and what the former five had left him: delivering me the keyes of their three
Clogbags before the Consul, declared by his mouth that he left me absolute heire to
intromet with all, and whatsoever they had there: But eftsoones the treacherous Consul,
knowing that I was a stranger to them, and by accident met together at Jerusalem,
and that they were Gentlemen, and well provided with gold, forgd a reason to himselfe
and for his owne benefit, that he would meddle with all they left behind them, under
this excuse, that he would be answerable to their friends for it, at his returne to
Venice: Well, I am left to bury them, and with great difficulty bought one grave for
them all three in a Copties Chappell, where I interred them: paying to the Ægyptian
Christians for that eight foote of ground, ten Sultans of gold, besides sixe Piasters
for carrying their corps hither, <span class="right-marginnote">[VII. 303.]</span>being two miles in the City distant from the Consuls house. Whence, ere I had returned,
the Venetian Factor <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268">268</a>]</span>seased upon all, and shuting his gate upon my face, sent me out my owne budget: Whereupon
I addressed my selfe to the French Consul, Monsieur Beauclair, who kindly received
me, and having told him all the manner, how I was greatly wronged &amp; oppressed by the
other Consul; he straight sent for a Jewish Phisitian, his familiar Oracle: Where
having consulted together, the next day earely we went all three, and their followers
to the Beglerbeg, or governour of the City: we soone complained, and were as soone
heard: the Venetian Consul is sent for, and he commeth: where facing the Judge and

immediatly determined that I should have the two part of their moneyes, with all their
Jerusalem relicts, and Turkish cloathes, and the Venetian to have the former third
part. It is done, and irrevocable, upon which the Jewish Doctor, and I, with two Janizaries
came to mine adversaries house; where I giving the Jew the keyes, the Clogbags were
opened, and the money being told, it came just to 1424. Chickens of gold, besides
certaine rings &amp; tablets: The Jew delivered me my part, which came to 942. Chickens,
the rest went to the inconscionable Consul, with the halfe of the rings &amp; tablets:
And packing up all the relicts, moneyes, clothes, and Clogbags, I hired a Mule, and
brought them along with me to the French Factors house. Where, when come, Monsieur
Beauclair, and my fellow Pilgrimes, were very glad that I had sped so well, none of
us all knowing what was in the Clogbags till they were sighted; &amp; giving hearty thanks
to the Consul, and ten peeces of gold to the <span class="right-marginnote">[VII. 304.]</span>Jew and Janizaries, I sup&#x2019;d, and reposed till the morrow, thanking God of my good
fortune: Yet was I exceeding sorrowfull for the losse of these gallant Gentle-men,
Religiously disposed, and so affable, that for familiarity and kindnesse, they were
the mirrours of noble mindes, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href="#pb269">269</a>]</span>and vertuous spectacles of humanity; whose Deaths were to mee a Hell, and whose lives
had beene my Paradice on earth. To whose memory and prayse, I am not able to Congratulate
the least Commendation, their Heroicke dispositions, deserved at my hands.
</p>
<p>But what shall I say, their time was come, which mortality might sorrow, but sorrow
might not prevent Death, whose power is deafe to all humane lamentations. Neyther
will I relye so much upon my owne worthinesse, as to thinke that benefite of the procrastination
of my <span class="marginnote"><i>Gods provident mercies.</i></span>Life, was by any merite of mine deserved, but that God so much the more, might show
his incomprehensible goodnesse in delivering me, from the violence of such unexpected
accidents, and to tye my soule to be thankfull for his mercies. For all the beginnings
of man are derived from God, whose ends are eyther perfited, or disanulled by his
Determination: and nothing we possesse is properly our owne, or gotten by our owne
power, but given us onely through his goodnesse and munificence.
</p>
<p>And all the spaces of earth which our feet tread over, the Light we enjoy, and the
excellent faculties wee are indued withall; or what we can do, say, or thinke, is
onely raised, guided, and distributed, by Gods impenetrable Counsell, Will, and Providence:
Which although the pride of our wicked nature doth not yeeld the true attribution
thereunto; yet the powerfull working of the counsell <span class="right-marginnote">[VII. 305.]</span>of God is such, that in it selfe, it proveth an eternall wisdome, and confoundeth
the foolishnesse of the world.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The great City of Grand Cayre.</i></span>This incorporate World of Grand Cairo, is the most admirable and greatest City, seene
upon the earth, being thrice as large of bounds as Constantinople, and likewise so
populous, but not so well builded, being situate in a pleasant Plaine, and in the
heart of Ægypt, kissing Nylus at some parts.
</p>
<p>The City is divided in five Townes, first and formost, Cairo novo, the new Caire,
which is the principall &amp; chiefest place of all the other, lying in midst of the rest,
having walles and Ports, the circuit whereof is 22. miles, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270">270</a>]</span>contayning al the chiefe merchandise and market places within it.
</p>
<p>The second is Cairo Vecchio, the old Caire, called formerly Cairo de Babylonia or
Babylon Ægyptiorum: for there were two Babylons, one in Assiria called now by the
Turkes Bagdat, and the other is this that joyneth with the new Caire: It was also
aunciently called Memphis, and was the furthest place that Ulysses in his travels
visited, so well memorized by Homer: yet a voyage of no such estimation, as that princely
Poet accounted it; for his travels were not answerable, to the fifteene part of mine<span class="corr" id="xd29e6396" title="Source: :">.</span>
</p>
<p>The third Towne is Medin, joyning to the backe side of the old Caire, toward the Piramides:
The fourth is Boulak, running a great length downe along and neare the River side,
having three market places of no small account: The fift and last, is the great Towne
of Caraffar, bending Southward, in the way of the red Sea for many miles: All which
are but as Suburbs to the new Caire, that of many smalles make up a Countrey, rather
then a <span class="right-marginnote">[VII. 306.]</span>City: And yet all of them are contiguat one with another, either to the left or right
hand, or to them both, with innumerable streets: <span class="marginnote"><i>The length of great Cayre and the bounds thereof.</i></span>The length whereof in all, from the lowest end of Boulak, to the South-most part of
Caraffar is by my deepe experience twenty eight English miles, and fourteene in breadth;
for tryall whereof I troad it one day on foote from Sun to Sunne, being guided and
guarded with a riding Janizarie, which for my bruised feete on the streets, was one
of the sorest dayes journey that ever I had in my life.
</p>
<p>The principall gates of new Caire are Babell Mamstek looking toward the Wildernesse
and the Red Sea: Bebzavillah toward Nylus, and Babell Eutuch toward the fields: The
streets are narrow, being all of them almost covered to save them from the parching
heate with open vents for light; and their buildings commonly are two stories high,
composed either of mudde or bricke, and platforme on the tops; whereon usually in
the night they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271">271</a>]</span>use to sleepe to imbrace the fresh &amp; cooling ayre. Their Bazar or exchange, beginneth
at the gate of Mamsteck, and endeth at a place called Babeso.
</p>
<p>At the corners of chiefe streets or market places, there are divers horses standing
ready sadled and bridled, that for a small matter, or according to the way, a man
may hire and ride so where he will, either to negotiat, or to view this spacious spred
City, and change as many horses as he listeth, having the Maisters which owe them
to convoy them for lesse or longer way, which is a great ease to weary passengers.
</p>
<p>There is a great commerce here with exceeding many nations, for by their concurring
hither, it is wonderfully peopled with infinite numbers: for the Countrey <span class="right-marginnote">[VII. 307.]</span>aboundeth in Silkes, Cornes, Fruits, Waxe, Honey, and the soveraigne Balsamo good
for all sores, besides many other commodities of Cotten-wooll, rich Stuffes of cloth
of gold and silver, and the best Sattins, Damas, Taffaties, and Grograines that are
made in the world are here.
</p>
<p>The infinite populositie of which place, and the extreame heate, is the cause why
the pest is evermore in the City: insomuch, that at some certaine times, ten thousand
persons have dyed in one day: Nay, the City is reputed to be in good health, if there
dye but one, or two thousand in a day, or three hundred thousand in a whole yeare,
I meane, when the soare encroaching pestilence, which every third yeare useth to visite
them, is rife here.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Divers nations residing in Cayre.</i></span>In this Towne a Traveller may ever happily finde all these sorts of Christianes, Italians,
French, Greekes, Chelfaines, Georgians, Æthiopians, Jacobines, Syrians, Armenians,
Nicolaitans, Abassines, Cypriots, Slavonians, captivat Maltezes, Sicilians, Albaneses,
and high Hungarians, Ragusans, and their owne Ægyptian Copties; the number of which
is thought to be beyond two hundred thousand people: besides the infinite number of
Infidels, whose sorts are these, Turkes, tawny Moores, white Moores, blacke Moores,
or Nigroes, Musilmans, Tartars, Persians, Indians, Sabuncks, Berdoanes, Jewes, Arabians,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272">272</a>]</span>Barbares, and Tingitanian Sarazens. All which are Mahometans, and Idolatrous Pagans<span class="corr" id="xd29e6433" title="Not in source">.</span>
</p>
<p>From the great Palatiat Mansion, where the Begler-Beg, or Vicegerent hath his residence,
being builded on a moderate height; a man may have the full prospect of the better
part of the Towne, the gardens and Villages <span class="right-marginnote">[VII. 308.]</span>bordering on Nylus, and a great part of the lower plaines of Ægypt. Their Lawes heere
and Heathnish Religion, are Turkish and Mahometanicall, and the Customes and Manners
of the people, are like unto their birth and breeding, beastly and Barbarous; being
great Sodomites, and Diabolically given to all sorts of abhominations.
</p>
<p>The better sort of Women here, and all the Kingdom <span class="marginnote"><i>The Egyptian decorements.</i></span>over, weare Rings of gold or silver, through the hollow of their noses, both endes
of their mouthes, and in their under lips; hanging rich pearles, and precious stones
to them; wearing also about their armes faire Bracelets, and about their ancles below,
broad bonds of gold or silver. To which if the baser sort can not attayne unto, then
they counterfeit their Betters, with Rings, Bracelets, and bonds of Brasse, Copper,
Lead, and white Iron, and thinke themselves not worthy to live, unlesse they weare
these badges.
</p>
<p>They also use here, as commonly they do through all Turkey, the Women to pisse standing,
and the men to coure low on their knees, doing the like. They weare here linnen breeches
and Leather bootes as the men do, and if it were not for their covered faces, and
longer gownes, wee would hardly know the one from the other. <span class="marginnote"><i>The Egyptian Christians.</i></span>As for the Religion of the Copties or Ægyptian Christians, they are Circumcised, after
the Judaicall manner, but not after the eight day, but the eight yeare. And it is
thought, they follow the Religion of Eutyches, holding but one nature in Christ: which
was defended by Dioscorus and the Counsell of Ephesus, in regard of Eutyches. But
the Copties them selves say, they have their Religion from Prester Jehan, and so it
is most manifest, being no difference betweene the one and the other.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[VII. 309.]</span>They make frequently at all meetings the signe of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href="#pb273">273</a>]</span>Crosse to other, thwarting their two foremost fingers, lay them on their brow, and
then on their breasts, and kissing them, the salutation is done.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The Copties Religion.</i></span>They will not suffer no Images, nor Pictures to be in their Churches, and yet they
have an Altar, and a kinde of Masse, sayd in their owne Language, sacrificing the
Ostia, for the reall Body and Blood of Christ: Yet they deny Purgatory, the invocation
of Saints, and Prayers for the Dead, &amp;c. Neverthelesse auricular Confession is commonly
used among them: so do the Greekes in all these poynts the like, and all the people
Orientall.
</p>
<p>The Inhabitants here, were the first Inventors of the Mathematicall Sciences, of Letters,
and of the use of Writing: Great Magicians and Astrologians, and are yet <span class="marginnote"><i>The nature of the Egyptian Moores.</i></span>indued with a speciall dexterity of Wit; but somewhat sloathfull, and given to Ryot
and Luxury: Merry also, great Singers, and sociable Companions; and no wonder, the
Land being so plentifull, and their nature libidinous, it increaseth both their insolence,
and inordinate affections. Neyther doe they live long, in regard of the great heate
they indure. Ægypt being placed betweene the two Tropickes, under the Torrid Zone,
bringeth to passe, that seldome will any there attayne to threescore yeares of age.
</p>
<p>In all this Land of Ægypt, which is a great Kingdome, there is no running Well or
Fountayne, save onely the River Nylus: Neyther do the Inhabitants scarcely know what
Raine is, because they seldome see any, and if by rare accident, a Cloud happen to
dissolve upon them, it bringeth to their bodies innumerable soares and diseases. And
yet for abundance of Cornes, and all kind of fruites the Earth yeeldeth, there is
no Country can brag with <span class="right-marginnote">[VII. 310.]</span>Ægypt; whereupon it was called in the time of the Romanes, as well as Sicilia, Horreum
populi Romani. And notwithstanding this Kingdome produceth no Wines, neyther is garnished
with Vineyards, but that which strangers make use of are brought from Candy, Cyprus,
and Greece. The defect being thus, these Mahometanicall Moores observing strictly
the Law of their Alcoran, wil <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href="#pb274">274</a>]</span>neyther plant wines, nor suffer any to be planted, accounting it a deadly sin to drinke
Wine, but for Coffa, and Sherpet, composed Liquors, they drinke enough of.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The Garden of Balsamo.</i></span>As for their Balsamo, the Garden wherein it groweth, lyeth neere to the South-side
of Cayre, and inclosed with a high Wall, being sixe miles in compasse, and daily guarded
by Turkes. To which when I came, being Conducted with a Janizary, they would not suffer
me to enter, neyther any Christian, &amp; far lesse the Jewes: For not long ago, they
were the cause, that almost this Balme was brought to confusion; they having the custody
of it for certayne yeares.
</p>
<p>The Tree it selfe is but of three foote height, which keepeth evermore the colour
greene, having a broad three poynted leafe, which being thrice in the yeare incised
in the body and branches; it yeeldeth a red Water that droppeth downe in earthen Vessels,
which is the naturall Balsamo.
</p>
<p>And not far from this Garden, in a sandy Desart, is the place called Mommeis, which
are innumerable Caves cut foorth of a Rocke, whereunto the Corpes of the most men
in Cayro, are carried and interred. Which dead bodies remayne alwayes unputrified,
neyther yeeld they a stinking smell: Whereof experiments are plentiful at this day,
by the whole Bodies, Hands, or other parts, which by Merchants are now brought from
thence, and <span class="right-marginnote">[VII. 311.]</span>doth make the Mummia which Apothecaries use: The colour being very blacke, and the
flesh clung unto the bones.
</p>
<p>Now having viewed, and review&#x2019;d this Microcosmus of the greater World, the foure French
Pilgrimes and I, did <span class="marginnote"><i>The pyramides of Egypt.</i></span>hire a Janizary to conduct us to the great Pyramides, surnamed the Worlds wonders;
which are distant from Cayre about foure Leagues, standing beside or neare to the
bankes of Nylus: Where, when come, I beheld their proportion to bee Quadrangled, growing
smaller and smaller to the toppe, and builded with huge and large stones, the most
part whereof, are five foote broade, or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href="#pb275">275</a>]</span>there abouts, and nine in length, beeing of pure Marble.
</p>
<p>All the Historians that ever wrot of these Wonders, have not so amply Recited their
admirable greatnesse, as the experience of the Beholder, may testifie their excessive
greatnesse and height. The first and East-most we approached unto, is highest, and
by our Dragomans skilfull Report, amounted to eleven hundred and twenty sixe foote.
The Basis, or bottome whereof, being twelve hundred paces in Circuite, allowing every
square of the foure faces three hundred paces, and every pace two foote and a halfe.
Every Pyramide, having outwardly to ascend upon (though now for the most part demolished)
three hundred foure score and nine steps or degrees; each degree being three foote
high, and two foote and a halfe broad. By which computation, they amount in height
to the afore-sayde Relation, allowing to every foote, twelve inches. At last having
ascended upon the South side of this greatest Pyramide to the top, and that with great
difficulty, because of the broken degrees here and there: <span class="right-marginnote">[VII. 312.]</span>I was much ravished, to see such a large foure squared plat-forme, all of one intyre
stone, which covered the head; each square extending to seaventeene foote of my measure.
</p>
<p>It is yet a great marvaile to me, by what Engine, they could bring it up so safe to
such a hight: But as I conceive it, they behoved certaynely still to rayse it, and
take it with them, as they advanced the Worke, otherwise the Wit nor power of man,
could never have done it. Truely the more I beheld this strange Worke, the more I
was stricken in admiration: For before wee ascended, or came neare to this Pyramide,
the toppe of it seemed as sharpe as a poynted Dyamond; but when we were mounted thereon,
we found it so large, that in my opinion, it would have contayned a hundred men.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The greatest piramide of the three.</i></span>In the bottome whereof we found a great Cell, and within that through a straight and
narrow passage, a foure angled Roome; wherein there was standing the Relickes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276">276</a>]</span>of a huge and auncient Toombe, where belike hee that was the first Founder of this
Pyramide was inclosed. From the top of this Pyramide, our Jannizary did shoote an
Arrow in the ayre with all his force, thinking thereby it should have fallen to the
ground; but as we discended downe-wards, we found the Arrow lying uppon the steps,
scarse halfe way to the ground: From this, wee came to the middle Pyramide, which
a far off looked somewhat higher then the other two, but when we came to the roote
thereof, wee found it not so, for the stone-worke is a great deale lower, but the
advancement of the height, is onely because of a high ground whereon it standeth.
</p>
<p>It is of the same fashion of the first, but hath no degrees to ascend upon, neyther
hath the third Pyramide any at <span class="right-marginnote">[VII. 313.]</span>all; being by antiquity of time, all worne and demolished, yet an admirable worke,
to behold such Masses, and (as it were) erected Mountaines all of fine Marble. The
reason why they were first founded, is by many ancient Authors so diversly conjectured,
that I will not meddle therewith. They were first called Pharaones.
</p>
<p>Yet the first and greatest is said to have beene builded by Cheops, who in this worke
imployed 100000. men, <span class="marginnote"><i>The charges of the greatest pyramide.</i></span>the space of twenty yeares: In which time, the charges of Garlick, Rootes, and Onions
onely, came to 1600. talents of silver; the Basis whereof in circuit, was sixty Acres
of ground. It is recorded by Josephus, and conjectured by many good witnesses, that
the Bricks which the Children of Israel were inforced to make, were partly imployed
about the insides of these Piramides, whose outsides were adorned with Marble; neither
can I forget the drift of that effeminate Cheops, who in end wanting money did prostitute
his daughter to all commers, by which detestable meanes he finished his building,
and shee besides the money due unto her unnaturall Father, desired for her selfe of
every man that had the use of her body one stone, of whom she got so many, that with
them she builded the second Piramide, almost equall to the first. Besides these three
huge ones, there are a number of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href="#pb277">277</a>]</span>smaller, whereof some were transported to Rome in the time of her supreame domination.
</p>
<p>Betweene the biggest Pyramide, and Nylus, I saw a Colosse, or head of an Idoll, of
a wonderfull greatnesse; being all of one Marble stone, erected on a round Rock: It
is of height (not reckoning the Columne) above 815. foote, and of circuite, 68. Pliny
gave it the name Sphingo, and reported much more of the bignesse, largenesse, and
length of it: but howsoever he erred in his description, yet I resolve my selfe, it
is of so great a <span class="right-marginnote">[VII. 314.]</span>quantity, that the like thereof (being one intire peece) the world affoordeth not,
and may be reckoned amongst the rarest wonders: Some say, that aunciently it was an
Oracle, the which so soone as the Sunne set, would give an answere to the Egyptians,
of any thing by them demanded.
</p>
<p>In our way as we returned, our Dragoman shewed us (on the banke of Nylus) where a
Crocodile was killed the yeare before, by the ingenious policy of a Venetian Merchant,
being licentiated by the Bassaw. The match whereof for bignesse and length, was never
seene in that River, whose body was twenty two foote long, and in compasse of the
shoulders, eight foote, who thus was slaine: This beast for foure yeares together
kept alwaies about one place of the River, being seven miles above Cayre; where for
a mile of ground, there was no tillage nor pastorage, being for feare of him layd
wast: and neverthelesse he had devoured above forty sixe persons: his custome was
to come forth of the River every morning, about our eight houres; where here and there
he would lurke waiting for his prey till ten, for longer from water he could not stay.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>A resolute Venetian Merchant.</i></span>This Venetian leaving his ship at Alexandria, and comming to Cayre, was informed by
the Consul my adversary of the great spoyle done by this beast: and herewith generously
he undertooke to kill it, the Vicegerent licentiating him: Whereupon going to his
ship, fetched thence his Gunner, and a peece of Ordonance to Cayre.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278">278</a>]</span>
</p>
<p>The next day in the afternoone, hee being well horsed, and accompanied with twenty
Janizaries, the peece is carried to the Crocodiles accustomary place, of forthcomming:
where straight there was an Asse slaine, and <span class="right-marginnote">[VII. 315.]</span>hung up on two standing and a thwarting tree, with his open belly to the flood, and
some twelve scorepaces therefrom: Behinde this carkasse, about other twelve score,
the piece was planted, and levelld at the Carrion, being charged with cut iron; and
a traine of powder about the touch-hole, and above it a night-house to keepe the trayne
dry from the nights serene: having a cock fastned thereto, and in it a burning match,
to which a string was tyed: Then forty paces behinde the piece, was there a pit digged
to hide the Gunner; wherein he was put, holding the strings end in his hand, and his
head vayled with a wooden covert.
</p>
<p>After this, and about mid-night, the Horse-men retired themselves two miles off: The
morning come, and the convenient time: the Crocodile courts the land: where when he
saw the carkasse, came grumbling to it, and setting his two foremost feet on the Carrions
middle, begun to make good cheare of the intrales: whereat the squink-eyed Gunner
perceiving his time, drew the string, <span class="marginnote"><i>The killing of a great Crocodile.</i></span>and giving fire, off went the piece, and shot the Crocodile in three parts: well,
he is deadly wounded, and making a horrible noyse, the Gunner lay denned, and durst
not stirre: meanewhile the beast striving to recover the water, tyred, and lying close
on his belly there he dyed.
</p>
<p>After the shot, the Horse-men drew neare, and finding the beast slaine, relieved the
Gunner, and brought with them this monstruous creature to Cayre; where now his skinne
hangeth in the Consuls Hall, which I saw during my stay in his house. For this piece
of service, the Merchant was greatly applauded, &amp; scorned to take from the City 500.
Sultans of gold as a reward for his paines, which they freely offered him, and he
as freely refused.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[VII. 316.]</span>Now to discourse of Nylus, this flood irriguateth all the low playnes of the Land,
once in the yeare, which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279">279</a>]</span>inundation, beginneth usually in the latter end of July; and continueth to the end
of August: Which furnisheth with Water all the Inhabitants; being the onely drinke
of the vulgar Ægyptians; and of such vertue, that when Pescennius Niger saw his Souldiers
grumble for Wine, What (sayth hee) doe you grumble for Wine, having the Water of Nylus
to drinke. And now because many schollers, and learned men, are meerely mistaken about
<span class="marginnote"><i>The true knowledge of the flowing of Nylus.</i></span>the flowing of Nylus, I will both show the manner and quality or cause of its inundation,
and thus. There is a drye pond called Machash digged neare unto the brinke of the
River, in midst whereof standeth a pillar of eighteene Cubites height, being equall
with the profundity of the Ditch, whereby they know his increasing: and in the yeare
following if they shal have plenty or scarcity of things.
</p>
<p>Now betweene the River and this pond, there are sixe passages or spouts digged through
the Banke; where when the River beginneth to swell, it immediately fals downe through
the lowest passage into the pond, and being discovered there comes forth of Cayre,
certayne of the Priests called Darvishes, accompanied with a hundred Janizaries, and
pitch their Tents round about this Quadrangled pit. In all which time of the Inundation,
they make great Feastings, rare Solemnities, with Dancing, Singing, toucking of kettle
Drummes, sounding of Trumpets, and other ostentations of joy.
</p>
<p>Now as the Water groweth in the River, and so from it debording, so it groweth also
upon the Pillar standing in this pond, which pillar is marked from the roote to <span class="right-marginnote">[VII. 317.]</span>the top, with Brasses, handfuls, a foote, a span, and an inch: And so if it shall
happen that the water rise but to ten Brasses, it presageth the yeare following there
shal be great Dearth, Pestilence, and famine. And if it amounteth to twelve Cubites,
then the sequell yeare shal be indifferent. And if it swell to fifteene Brasses, then
the next yeare shal be copious and abundant in all things: And if it shall happen
to flow to the top, eighteen Brasses, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href="#pb280">280</a>]</span>then all the Country of Ægypt, is in danger to be drowned and destroyed.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Many Schollers mistaken about Nylus.</i></span>Now from the body of Nylus, there are above three thousand Channels drawne through
the playne, on which passing Ditches, are all the Bourges and Townes builded; and
through which Channels the River spreads it selfe through all the Kingdome: Which
when scoured, of filth and Wormes, and the water become cleare, then every House openeth
their Cisterne window, and receiveth as much water, as is able to suffice them till
the next Inundation: Neyther doth ever the River flow any where above the Bankes,
for if it should, it would overwhelme the whole Kingdome.
</p>
<p>All which Channels here or there, do make intercourse for their streames agayne, to
the body and branches of Nylus. Now Stoicall fooles hold the opinion, that it overfloweth
the whole face of the Land, then I pray you, what would become of their Houses, their
Bestiall, their Cornes and fruites? for the nature of violent streames, do ever deface,
transplant, and destroy all that they debord upon, leaving slime, mood, and Sand behind
their breaches, and therefore such inunding can not be called cherishings.
</p>
<p>There are infinite venemous Creatures bred in this river, as Crocadiles, Scorpions,
Water-Snakes, grievous mis-shapen <span class="right-marginnote">[VII. 318.]</span>Wormes, and other Monstrous things, which oft annoy the Inhabitants, and these who
Trafficke on the Water. This famous flood is in length almost three thousand miles,
and hath his beginning under the Æquinoctiall Line, from montes Lunæ, but more truly
from the Zembrian Lake in Æthyopia interior, whence it bringeth the full growth downe
into Ægypt, and in a place of the exterior Æthiopian Alpes called Catadupa: The fall
and roaring of Nyle, maketh the people deafe that dwell neere to it.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The reason of the flowing of Nylus.</i></span>The infallible reason, why Nylus increaseth so every yeare, at such a time and continuance,
is onely this; that when the Sunne declining Northward to Cancer, and warming with
his vigorous face, the Septentrion sides <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href="#pb281">281</a>]</span>of these Cynthian mountaynes, the abundant Snow melteth: from whence dissolving in
streames, to the Lake Zembria, it ingorgeth Nylus so long as the matter delabiates:
For benefit of which River, the great Turke is inforced, to pay yearely the tribute
of fifty thousand Sultans of gold to Prester Jehan, least he impede and withdraw the
course of Nylus to the Red Sea, and so bring Ægypt to desolation: The ground and policy
whereof, begunne upon a desperate Warre inflicted upon the Æthiopians by Amurath,
which hee was constrayned to give over, under this pact, and for Nylus sake.
</p>
<p>The River Nyle had many names, for Diodore named it Actos, to wit, Eagle, because
of its swift passing over the Catadupian heights: It was called too, Ægyptus, of a
King so named, that communicated the same to it, and to the Countrey.
</p>
<p>Festus, sayth it was called Melos, and Plutarch tearmed it Mela: Epiphanio called
it Chrysoroas, that is, running, or coulant in gold. The Holy Scripture tearmeth it
Seor <span class="right-marginnote">[VII. 319.]</span>or Sihor, to wit, Trouble, because of the great noyse it bringeth with it to Ægypt;
and the same Holy Letters call it Gehou, and Physon. The Ægyptians wont to name it
Nospra; and now presently the Abassines, and Inhabitants of Ægypt, name it Abanhu,
to wit, the River of a long course.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The Ile of Delta.</i></span>This River maketh the Ile of Delta in Ægypt; so likewise in Æthiopia, that Ile of
Meroa so renowned. The ancient Authors, could not agree, touching the mouthes of Nylus;
for Melo, Strabo, Diodore, and Heredotus place seaven; Ptolomy, and others nine; and
Pliny eleaven. And some moderne Authors affirme it hath onely foure, as Tyrre and
Behou alleadge, dividing it selfe two leagues below Cayre in foure branches, the chiefest
two whereof, are these of Damiota and Roseta, but that is false, and so are the opinions
of all the rest, for it hath now eight severall mouthes, and as many branches drawne
from its mayne body.
</p>
<p>The Water of Nyle is marvailous sweete, above all <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282">282</a>]</span>others in the World, and that proceedeth of the extreame vigour of the Sunne, beating
continually upon, it maketh it become more Lighter, Purer, and Simple; as likewise
arrousing of so many Soyles, and his long Course.
</p>
<p>And truely it is admirable, to see this River to grow great, when all others grow
small; and to see it diminish, when others grow great. So alwayes it is no wonder,
that the nature of this River should so increase, when even here, and at home, the
river of Rhone, hath the like intercourse: and at the same time, through the Towne
of Geneve, and so to the Mediterranean Sea: Their beginnings being both alike; from
the impetuosity of raynes, and dissolvings of Snow.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[VII. 320.]</span>Ægypt was first inhabited by Misraim, the Sonne of Chus from whom the Arabians name
the land Misre, in the Hebrew tongue Misroiæ. It was also named Oceana, from Oceanus
the second King hereof. Thirdly, Osiriana from Osiris; and now Ægyptus from Ægyptus
the surname of Rameses, once a King of great puissance. <span class="marginnote"><i>The confines of Egypt.</i></span>It bordereth with Æthiopia, and the Confines of Nubia: on the South. On the North
with the sea Mediterrene: The chiefest ports whereof, are Damieta, and Alexandria,
towards the occident, it joyneth with the great Lake Bouchiarah, and a daungerous
Wildernesse confining therewith, supposed to be a part of Cyrene; so full of wilde
and venemous beasts, which maketh the West part unaccessable: And on the East, with
the Istmus, and Confine of Desartuous Arabia, and a part of the Red Sea, through which
the people of Israel passed.
</p>
<p>This Country was governed by Kings first, and longest of all other Nations: From <span class="corr" id="xd29e6636" title="Source: Orisis">Osiris</span> (not reckoning his Regall Ancestors) in whose time Abraham went downe to Ægypt, he
and his Successours, were all called Pharaoes; of whom Amasis, is onely worthy mention,
who instituted such politicke Lawes to the auncient Egyptians, that he deserveth to
be Catalogized, as founder or this Kingdome.
</p>
<p>This Race continued till Cambises the second Persian <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href="#pb283">283</a>]</span>Monarch, made Ægypt a member of his Empire: and so remayned till Darius Nothus the
sixt Persian King: from whom they Revolted, choosing Kings of themselves. But in the
eighteene yeare of Nectanebos the seventh King thereafter, Ægypt was recovered by
Ochus, the eight Emperour of Persia.
</p>
<p>In end Darius being vanquished, and Alexander King hereof, after his Death it fell
to the share of Ptolomeus, the sonne of Lagi, from whom the Kings of Ægypt were <span class="right-marginnote">[VII. 321.]</span>for a long time called Ptolomeis: of whom Queene Cleopatra was the last, after whose
selfe murther, it was annexed for many yeares to the Romane Empire, and next to the
Constantinopolitan: from whose insupportable burden they revolted, and became tributaries
for a small time to Haumar the third Caliph of Babylon.
</p>
<p>Afterward being oppressed by Almericus King of Jerusalem; Noradin a Turkish King of
Damascus sent Saracon a valiant Warriour to aide them, who made him <span class="marginnote"><i>The alterations of Egypt.</i></span>selfe absolute King of the whole Countrey; whose ofspring succeeded (of whom Saladine
was one, the glorious conquerour of the East) till Melechsala, who was slaine by his
owne souldiers the Mamaluks; who were the guard of the Suldans, as the Jannizaries
are to the great Turke, who lately, Anno 1622. have almost made the like mutation
in the Turkish Empire, as the Mamaluks did in the Ægyptian.
</p>
<p>They made of themselves Sultans, whereby the Mamaluke race continued from the yeare
1250. till the yeare 1517. wherein Tonembius, together with his predecessour Campson
Gaurus, was overcome by Selimus the first; by whom Ægypt was made a Province of the
Turkish Empire, and so continueth as yet.
</p>
<p>The length of this Kingdome, is foure hundred and fifty English miles, and two hundred
broad: the principal seat whereof is the great Caire, being distant from Jerusalem
sixteene dayes journey, or Caravans journalls, amounting to 240. of our miles. Some
hold that the space of earth, that lyeth betweene the two branches of Damieta, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href="#pb284">284</a>]</span>Roseta was called the lower Ægypt; now called Delta under the figure of a Greeke letter
triangular.
</p>
<p>The head of this great Delta, where Nylus divideth it selfe was called Heptapolis,
or Hoptanomia; and Delta <span class="right-marginnote">[VII. 322.]</span>it selfe was called by the Romanes Augustamia: Ægypt besides the aforesayd names,
it had divers Epithites of divers Authors; for Appollodorus tearmed it the Religion
of Melampodes, because of the fertility of it: And Plutarch gave it the name Chimia,
because of the holy ceremonies of the Ægyptians in worshipping their Gods: The Etymology
whereof Ortelius condignely remarked, deriving it from Cham, the sonne of Noah, so
that some hold the opinion, that the Ægyptians had their originall from Misraim (for
so was Ægypt called) the sonne of Chus, that proceeded from Cham Noahs sonne: The
circuit of Delta or the lower Ægypt is thought to be 3000. of their stades, which
maketh a hundred Spanish leagues.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The revenews of Egypt.</i></span>In the time of the Ptolomeis the revenewes of this Kingdome were 12000. talents; so
also in the time of the Mamaluks; but now through tyranical government, and discontinuance
of trafficke through the red sea, the Turke receiveth no more than three millions
yearely; one of the which is free to him selfe, the other two are distributed to support
the charge of his Vicegerent Bassaw, and presidiary souldiers, being 12000. Jannizaries,
besides their thousands of Timariots, which keepe Ægypt from the incursions and tyranny
of Arabs: In Cayro I stayed twelve dayes, and having bid farewell to Monsieur Beauclair
the Consul who courteously intertained me, the other foure French Pilgrimes and I
imbarked at Boulacque in a boate: And as we went downe the River, the chiefe Townes
of note we saw were these, Salmona, Pharsone, Fova, &amp; Abdan. I remember our boate
was double hooked with forked pikes of iron round about the sides, for feare of the
Crocodiles, who usually leape up on boates, and will carry the passenger away headlong
in the streame: And yet these beasts themselves are devoured by a water-Rat, of <span class="right-marginnote">[VII. 323.]</span>whom they taking great pleasure, and play, and gaping <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="#pb285">285</a>]</span>widely, the Rat running into his mouth, the other out of joy swalloweth it down, where
the Rat for disdaine commeth forth at the broad side of his belly leaving the Crocodile
dead. In these parts there is a stone called Aquiline, which hath the vertue to deliver
a woman from her paine in child-birth. In all this way the greatest pleasure I had,
was to behold the rare beauty of certaine Birds, called by the Turkes, Ellock; whose
feathers being beautified with the diversity of rarest colours, yeeld a farre off
to the beholder a delectable shew: having also this propriety, the nearer a man approacheth
them, the more they loose the beauty of their feathers by reason of the feare they
conceive when they see a man. Upon the third day we landed at Rosetta, and came over
land with a company of Turkes to Alexandria, being 50. miles distant.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The Towne of Alexandria.</i></span>Alexandria is the second Port in all Turky: It was of old a most renowned City, and
was built by Alexander the great, but now is greatly decayed, as may appeare by the
huge ruines therein: It hath two havens, the one whereof is strongly fortified with
two Castles, which defend both it selfe and also Porto vecchio: The fields about the
Towne are sandy, which ingender an infectious ayre, especially in the moneth of August,
and is the reason why strangers fall into bloody fluxes and other heavy sicknesses.
In my staying here, I was advised by a Ragusan Consul, to keepe my stomacke hot, to
abstaine from eating of fruit, and to live soberly, with a temperate diet: The rule
of which government, I strove diligently to observe, so did I also in all my travells
prosecute the like course of a small diet, and was often too small against my will,
by the meanes whereof (praised be God) I fell never sicke till my returne to France.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[VII. 324.]</span>This Citty is mightily impoverished since the Trading of Spices that were brought
through the red Sea, to Ægypt, and so over Land to Alexandria &amp; its Sea-port: Whence
the Venetian dispersed them over all Christendome; but are now brought home by the
backe-side of Affricke, by the Portugals, English, and Flemings, which maketh both
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href="#pb286">286</a>]</span>Venice, and Alexandria fare the worse, for want of their former Trafficke, and commerce
in these Southerne parts: whence Venice grew the mother nurse to all Europe for these
Commodities, but now altogether spoyled thereof, and decayed by our Westerne Adventures,
in a longer course for these Indian soyles.
</p>
<p>This Citty was a place of great Merchandize, and in the Nycen Councell was ordayned
to be one of <span class="marginnote"><i>The foure Patriarchall Seas.</i></span>the foure Patriarchall seas; the other three are Antiochia, Jerusalem, and Constantinople.
Heere in Alexandria was that famous Library which Ptolomeus Philadelphus filled with
700000. volumes: It was he that also caused the 72. Interpreters, to translate the
Bible: Over against Alexandria, is the little Ile Pharos, in the which for the commodity
of Saylers the aforesaid King builded a watch-towre of white Marble; being of so marvellous
a height, that it was accounted one of the seven wonders of the world: the other six,
being the Pyramides, the Tombe Mausolaea, which Helicarnassus Queene of Caria caused
build in honour of her Husband: the Temple of Ephesus, the Wals of Babylon, the Colossus
of Rhodes, and the Statue of Jupiter Olympicus at Elis in Greece, which was made by
Phidias, an excellent worke-master in Gold and Ivory, being in height 60. Cubites.
</p>
<p>Expecting fifteene dayes heere in Alexandria for passage, <span class="right-marginnote">[VII. 325.]</span>great was the heate the French men and I indured, in so much that in the day time,
we did nought but in a low roome, besprinckle the water upon our selves, and all the
night lye on the top or platforme of the house, to have the ayre; where at last bidding
good-night to our Greekish Host, we imbarked in a Slavonian shippe, belonging to Ragusa;
and so set our faces North for Christendome; in which ship I was kindly used, and
Christian-like intertayned both for victuals and passage. The Windes somewhat at the
beginning favouring us, wee weighed Anckers, and set forward to Sea: leaving the Coast
of Cyrene Westward from us, which lyeth betweene Ægypt by the Sea side, and Numidia,
or Kingdome of Tunnis.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287">287</a>]</span>
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The fabulous Countrey of Syrene.</i></span>The chiefe Cities therein are Cyrene, Arsinoa, and Barca whence the whole Cyrenean
Country taketh the modern name Barca Marmorica, anciently Penta Politana. The Soyle
is barren of Waters and Fruites, the people rude and theftuous: yet it hath bred the
most ingenious spirits of Calimachus the Poet; Aristippus the Phylosopher; Eratosthenes
the Mathematician, and Symon of Cyrene, whom the Jewes compelled to carry our Saviours
Crosse.
</p>
<p>In this Province, which is now reckoned as a part of Ægypt, stood the Oracle of Jupiter
Hammon, in the great Wildernesse confining with Lybia: Whither when Alexander travailed,
he saw for foure dayes space, neither man, Beast, Bird, Tree, nor River: Where, when
arrived, the flattering Priests, professed him to be the sonne of Jupiter: which afterward
(being hurt with an Arrow) hee found false, saying; Omnes me vocant filium Jovis,
sed hæc sagitta me probat esse mortalem. West from Cyrene all the Kingdomes of Tunnis,
Tremisen, Algier, Fesse, and a part of Morocco even to Gibilterre, or fretum <span class="right-marginnote">[VII. 326.]</span>Herculeum, under a generall name now called Barbary; and hardly can be distinguished
by the barbarous Moores.
</p>
<p>In the time of this our Navigation for Christendome, there dyed seaventeene of our
Mariners, and all our foure French Pilgrimes, two of them being gray hayred, and 60.
yeares of age, which bred no small griefe, and feare to us all, thinking that they
had dyed of the plague, for it was exceeding rife in Alexandria from whence wee came.
</p>
<p>The French men had onely left unspent among them all, threescore and nine Chickens
of gold, which the Master of the Ship medled with, and because they were Papists,
and they and I alwayes adverse to other, I could not clayme it. <span class="marginnote"><i>Foure French Pilgrimes dead.</i></span>Their dead Corpes were cast over Board, in a boundlesse Grave to feed the fishes,
and wee then expecting too the like mutation of Life; So likewise in our passage,
we were five sundry times assayled by the Cursares and Pyrats of Tunnis and Biserta;
yet unprevailing, for we were well provided with good Munition, and skilfull, Martiall,
and resolute Ragusans, and a Gallant ship.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href="#pb288">288</a>]</span>
</p>
<p>Our Ships burthen being sixe hundred Tunnes, did carry twenty eight peeces of Ordonance,
two of them brazen; and foure score strong and strenuous Saylers, besides nine Merchants
and Passengers. The greatnesse of our ship did more terrifie the roguish Runagats,
then any violent defence we made: for they durst never set on us, unlesse they had
beene three together; and yet we little regarded them, in respect of our long reaching
Ordonance, and expert Gunners: In these Circumstances of time, I remember, almost
every day, wee would see <span class="marginnote"><i>Flying fish.</i></span>flockes of flying Fishes, scudding upon the curling waves, <span class="right-marginnote">[VII. 327.]</span>so long as their finnes be wet, which grow from their backe, as feathred wings doe
from Fowles: But when they grow drye, they are forced to fall downe and wet them agayne,
and then flye along. Their flight will bee the length of a Cables Rope, untouching
Water; and in this their scudding, it is thought the Dolphin, is in persuing them,
who is their onely enemy in devouring and feeding upon them; whose bignesse and length
are like to Mackrels, but greater headed and shouldered. Meanewhile in these our Courses
were we seven weekes crossed with Northerly Windes, ever Tackling and boarding from
the Affricke Coast, to the Carminian shoare, in all which time wee saw no Land, except
the boysterous billowes of glassie Neptune: And as Ovid sayde, in the like case crossing

to arrive at Ragusa in the Adriaticke Gulfe, where I had beene before. Our <span class="marginnote"><i>A joyfull arrival in Malta.</i></span>Anchors being grounded, and our Boate ready to court the shoare, I bad farwell to
all the Company, and in a singular respect to my generous Captayne, who would have
nothing for my victuales and transportation from Ægypt; except a few relicts of Jerusalem:
The boat being launched, and we landed in the haven, I accoasted a vulgar Taverne,
and there lodged.

<p>This City is divided in two, the old and new Malta, <span class="right-marginnote">[VII. 330.]</span>from which the Ile taketh the name; it is a large and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href="#pb291">291</a>]</span>populous place, and strongly fortified with invincible walles, and two impregnable
Castles St. Hermes, and St. Angelo; St. Michael being distant from both: Here the
great Master or Prince for that yeare being a Spaniard made much of me for Jerusalems
sake; so did also a number of these gallant Knights, to whom I was greatly obliged.
And withall to my great contentment, I rancountred here with a countrey Gentleman

and good service at sea was solemnely Knighted, and made one of their order. Whose
fidele and manly services have beene since as plausibly regarded by the Maltezes,

Italy, but especially by the noble Gonzagaes, and dependant friends of the house of
Mantua; for whose losse, and accidentall death, they still heavily bemone: acknowledging
that the race of that Princely stock, by Gods judgements was cut off, because of his
untimely death.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The Ile of Malta.</i></span>Malta was called Melita, mentioned Acts 28. 1. 2. where the Viper leaped on Paules
hand; I saw also the Creeke wherein he was shipwracked: This Iland may properly be
termed the Fort of Christendome, yet a barren place, and of no great bounds, for their
Cornes, and Wines come daily by Barkes from Sycilia: but it yeeldeth good store of
Pomegranates, Cittrons, Cottons, Orenges, Lemmons, Figges, Mellons, and other excellent
fruits. The Knights of Malta had their beginning at Acre in Palestina; from thence
to the Rhodes, &amp; now exposed to this rocky Ile. They are pertinacious foes to Infidels,
for such is the oath of their order, continually making war and <span class="right-marginnote">[VII. 331.]</span>incursions against them, to their power: being strengthned also with many souldiers,
and their Captaines are surnamed Knights of Malta, and so through a great part of
Christendome; it is a most honourable Order: They are not permitted to marry, the
most part of whom being younger brothers: the reason was, because not being intangled
to wife and children, they might be the more resolute to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href="#pb292">292</a>]</span>adventure their lives in the Christian service; but therein they are mightily decayed,
and their valour no way answerable to that it hath been when their auncestors lived
in the Rhodes and holy Land; having had these eighteene yeares past little or no good
fortune at all.
</p>
<p>This Ile was given in possession to these Knights of St. John, by the Emperour Charles
the fifth, and King of Spaine; being newly expelled from the Rhodes by Solyman the
magnificent, Anno 1522. And afterward the Turke not contented therewith, and mindfull
all-utterly to extermine their power, came with a huge Armado, and assayled Malta,
Anno 1565. when Valetta was great <span class="marginnote"><i>An invincible victory.</i></span>maister, who so couragiously withstood their fury, that the Turkes were defeated,
and forced to returne.
</p>
<p>This Iland is ten leagues in length, and three broad: the earth whereof being three
foote deepe, is the cause, why it is not so fertile, as the clymat might afford: It
containeth besides the City, forty seven Villages and nine Cassales; the peasants
or naturall Inhabitants whereof, are of the Affrican complexion, tanny, and Sun-burnt;
and their language semblable to the Barbarian speech, without any great difference,
both tongues being a corrupt Arabick: And not unlike therein to the Italians from
the Latine, or the vulgar Greeke from the auncient; yet the moderne Greeke is nearer
the auncient, then the Italian <span class="right-marginnote">[VII. 332.]</span>is the Latine: These rurall Maltezes are extreamely bent, in all their actions, either
to good or evill wanting fortitude of minde, and civill discretion, they can not temper
the violent humours of their passions, but as the headstrong-tide, so their dispositions
runne, in the superfluous excesse of affections.
</p>
<p>They follow the Romane Church, though ignorant of the way, and their woemen be lovely
faire, going head-covered with blacke vayles, and much inclined to <span class="marginnote"><i>The nature of the Maltezes.</i></span>licentiousnesse; their beauties being burrowed from helpe more then nature: for now
it is a common practice amongst decayed beauties, banquerouted by time or accidents,
to hide it from others eyes with Art, and from their owne <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href="#pb293">293</a>]</span>with false glasses. But (alasse) the graces and beauties of the soule ought more to
be cared for, and to have the first place and honour, above these counterfeit or outward
showes of the body; and the beauty and lovely proportion of the body, should be preferred
before the effeminate deckings, that the body doth rather carry then enjoy: since
it often hapneth; that a foule and deformed carkasse hath a faire and rich wardrope.
In this Towne of Malta, there are many Turkish and Moorish slaves, very rudely treat,
yet not answerable to that cruelty the slavish Christianes indure upon their Gallies
in Barbary or Turky: The discription of Malta, I postpone to the succeeding relations
of my second Travells; and after twelve daies staying here, I imbarked in a Frigat
with other passengers, and arrived at Cicly in the South-east corner of Sicilia, being
three score miles distant.
</p>
<p>From thence coasting the shoare fifty miles to Siracusa, I rancounterd by the way,
in a clifty Creeke close by the sea side, a Moorish Brigantine, with twelve oares
on each side, charged with Moores, who had secretly stayed there <span class="right-marginnote">[VII. 333.]</span>a night and a day stealing the people away labouring on the fields: At which sudden
sight, and being hard by them, I stopped my pace. Whereupon, about twenty Moores broke
out upon me, with shables &amp; slings: But my life and liberty being deare to me, my
long traced feete became more nimble in twelve score paces, than they could follow
in eighteene; for I behoved to fly backe the same way I came: where, when freed, I
hastned to the next Watch-tower, marine set, and there told the Centinell, how a <span class="marginnote"><i>A Moorish Brigantine.</i></span>Moorish Brigantine was lying within two miles at an obscure clift: and how hardly
I escaped their hands: whereupon he making a fire on the top of the Tower, and from
him all the Watch-towers along, gave presently warning to the contrey; so that in
a moment, them of the Villages came downe on horse and foote, and well armed, and
demanding me seriously of the trueth, I brought them with all possible celerity to
the very place: where forthwith the Horse-men broke upon them, wounding <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href="#pb294">294</a>]</span>divers, before they were all taken, for some fled to the Rocks, and some were in the
coverd fields hunting their prey: At last they were all seazed upon, and fast tyed
two, and two in iron chaines, and sixe Sicilians relieved whom they had stolne and
thralled: Whence they were carried to Syracusa, I went also along with them, where,
by the way the people blessed me, and thanked God for mine escape, and me for discovering
them: from Syracusa (being condemned to the galleyes) upon the third day they were
sent to Palermo, being 36. in number.
</p>
<p>They gone, and I reposing here, the governour of that place, for this piece of service,
and my travels sake did feast me three dayes, and at my departure would have rewarded
me with gold, so also the friends of them that <span class="right-marginnote">[VII. 334.]</span>were relieved, which if I tooke or not judge you, that best can judge on discretion.
This Citty is situate on a Promontore, that butteth in the Sea, having but one entery,
and was once the Capitall seat of the Kingdom, though now by old tyranies, and late
alterations of time, it is onely become a private place: Yet girded about with the
most fragrant fields, for dainty fruites, and delicate Muscatello that all Europe
can produce.
</p>
<p>From this place, over-tracing other fifty miles to Catagna, situate at Ætnaes foote;
I measured the third fifty miles to Messina. Where now I cease to discourse any further
of this Iland, till my returne for Affricke, being my second Voyage: For true it is,
double experience, deeper Knowledge; where then punctually in my following order,
the Reader I hope shall finde his desired satisfaction.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>An happy arrivall.</i></span>From Messina, I imbarked in a Neapolitan Boat loaden with Passingers; whence shoaring
along for foure hundred miles, the higher and lower Calabrian Coast, with a part of
the Lavorean lists, uppon the twelfth day, we landed at Naples. Where being disbarked,
I gave God thankes upon my flexed knees, for my safe arrivall in Christendome: And
meeting there with the Earle of Bothwell, and Captayne George Hepburne, I imbraced
the way to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href="#pb295">295</a>]</span>Rome, being sixe score and ten miles distant: where I stole one nights lodging privately,
and on the morrow earely departing thence, and crossing Tyber, I visited these Townes
in Italy before I courted the Alpes, Siena, Florence, Luca, Pisa, Genoa, Bullogna,
Parma, Pavia, Piacenza, Mantua, Milane, and Torine: the commendation of which Cities
rest revolv&#x2019;d in these following verses.

</div>
<p class="first">Having passed Torine, and its Princely Court, whose present Duke might have beene
the mirrour of Nobility, I kept my way through Piemont or Pedemontano, the sister
of Lombardy, and second Garden of Europe; and crossing the steepe and Snowy Mountayne
of Mont Cola <span class="marginnote"><i>The Ligurian Alpes.</i></span>di Tenda, the highest Hill of all the Alpes: I found on its top, that it reserveth
alwayes a Gradinian mist, for a mile of way long stakes, set in the Snow, each one
a Speares length from another, to guide the Passinger his dangerous way; of the which
stoopes if hee fayle, hee is lost for ever.
</p>
<p>After I had traversed this difficult passage, I had two dayes journey in climbing
and thwarting the Rockey and intricated hils of Liguria, over which Hannibal had so
much adoe, to conduct his Army to Italy; making a way through the Snow, with Fire,
Vineger, and Wine: Whence it was sayd of him, Viam aut inveniet Anniball, aut faciet:
Leaving these Mountaynes behind me, I <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb296" href="#pb296">296</a>]</span>arrived at Niece in Provance, situate on the Mediterren Sea; and passing the Townes
of Antibo and Cana, to night at Furges; there were three French murderers set uppon
me in a theevish Wood twelve miles long; one of <span class="right-marginnote">[VII. 336.]</span>which had dogged me hither from Niece: Where having extreamely given me a fearefull
chase, for a long League, and not mending themselves, they gave me over. Well, in
the midst of the Wood I found an Hostery, and in it, two Women, and three young Children,
with whom I stayed and lodged all night.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>A happy escape from murder.</i></span>After I had sup&#x2019;d and going to bed, in came these aforesayd Villaines, accompanied
with my Host; where, when seene, they straight accused me for my flight, and threatning
me with stroakes, consulted my Death. Then I cryed to my Host for helpe, but hee stood
dumbe, for he was their Companion, and to second their intention his wife made fast
the lower doore. Whereat being mooved with deadly feare, I pulled my Turkish gowne
from my backe, and opening my Sacket; sayd, Now Christian Gentlemen, I know you are
distressed, and so am I, come search my cloathes and Budget, and if you find what
you looke for, let me dye: Alas, I am a poore stranger, newly come from Jerusalem,
and the Sepulcher of Jesus Christ, and after long travailes, and loe there is my Patent:
And concerning my flight, I sweare, I onely fled for the safety of my life, but not
for the preservation of my money, for come see I have none: my griefe is that I have
it not for you: Good gentlemen consider the dangers that I have past amongst Infidels,
and let not your Christian hands rob me of my turmoyled life; having nought, wherefore
you should, were a lamentable thing to do.
</p>
<p>This spoken, and much more, they never searched me, nor touched my Wallet, but went
to Counsell, where they concluded uppon my forwardnesse in opening my body and other
things to them, that I had no money, and therefore <span class="right-marginnote">[VII. 337.]</span>confirmed my life, which for the former respect, and the Holy Graves sake was granted.
Whereupon packing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href="#pb297">297</a>]</span>up my Relickes agayne, they called for Wine, and drunke diverse times to me; and after
a long spent conference, there supper making ready, they dismissed me for my bed:
Whether, when led by my Hostesse, I privily made the doore fast, suspecting still
a suddaine death: Well they sup&#x2019;d, and were joviall, and at the first Cocke, went
foorth to the woode, and the high way for their owne ends.
</p>
<p>All which time I stood Centinell, and the morning come, my Host confessed, that onely
he had saved my life; forswearing himselfe of their former sight; but sayd hee certainly
they are Murderers. Leaving him with dissembling thankes, I arrived at Furges: where
I learned <span class="marginnote"><i>A guard of Horsemen for a dangerous wood.</i></span>that my Host was suspected to bee a Consort with these and many moe Murderers: well
afterwards I heard, hee was arraigned, hanged, and quartered, the house razed, and
his wife put to death; and ever since the French King, keepeth a guard of Horse-men
there to keepe that filthy and dangerous woode free from Murderers. For now may I
say, like to a ship that after a long Voyage, is eyther in greatest danger, or else
cast away, entring the Roade and Haven from whence shee came; even so was I cast in
the most eminent perill, that I had in all my Travayles, being on the Frontiers of
France, and as it were, (in regard of remoter places) entering the Towne wherein I
was borne.
</p>
<p>Having given humble thankes, and lofty prayses to the Almighty for my deliverance,
I traversed Provance, and Langadocke, where neare to Montpeillier, I met with the
French gentlemans Father, whom I relieved from the Gallies in Canea of Candy; who
being over-joyed with <span class="right-marginnote">[VII. 338.]</span>my sight, kindly intreated me for eight dayes, and highly rewarded mee with Spanish
Pistols, lamenting for my sake that his sonne was at Paris: whence continuing my Voyage
to Barselona in Catelogna of Spaine, I gave over my purpose in going to Madrile, because
of deare bedding and scarcity of Victuals: and footing the nearest way through Arragon
and Navarre, I crossed at the passage <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb298" href="#pb298">298</a>]</span>of Sancto Johanne, the Pyrhenei mountaines: And falling downe by Pau, and the River
Ortes, I visited Gascony and Bearne; and from them, the Cities of Burdeaux and Rochel:
and arriving at Paris, whence I first beganne my Voyage; I also there ended my first,
my painefull, and Pedestriall Pilgrimage. Whence shortly thereafter visiting Englands
Court, I humbly presented to King James, and Queene Anne of ever blessed memories;
and to his present Majesty King Charles, certayne rare Gifts and notable Relickes,
brought from Jordan and Jerusalem: Where afterward within a yeare, upon some distaste,
I was exposed to my second Peregrination as followeth.

<p class="xd29e2337"><span class="xd29e2337init">T</span>rue it is, that these who make Distinction clearely, and the certayne knowledge of
things, divide all Sciences in Speculative and Practicke. And agayne, Speculative
in Physicke, or Phylosophy naturall, in Mathematickes and Metaphysicke; placing Medicine
under the first: Arithmeticke, Musicke, Geometry, and Astrology under the second:
Uniting thirdly, Theology, to the which they give also to be adjoyned the right Canon.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[VIII. 341.]</span>As for the science Practique, it doth first imbrace the Morall that some divide in
three, to wit, Ethique, that doth forme the manners of one man, Secondly in Ecoenomick,
that doth dispose the actions domesticke: The third in Politicque, that comprehend
the actions Civill; concerning the government of Common-wealths, which containeth
under it the whole science of right civilitie. And with Practique, is also placed
Dialectique, the Art of memory, the Grammar, the Rhetorique, to which also may be
joyned the Art Poetique, and of Histories. But for their particular divisions I am
not prolixious, as inutile to my designe in hand; divers dedicate themselves to the
knowledge of these sciences, not knowing that they forget the most necessary, to wit,
the science of the world.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The necessary use and honour of Travels.</i></span>This is it above all things that preferreth men to honors, and the charges that make
great houses and Reipublicks <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb301" href="#pb301">301</a>]</span>to flourish; and render the actions and words of them who possesse it, agreeable both
to great and small. This science is onely acquisted by conversation, and haunting
the company of the most experimented: by divers discourses, reports, by writs, or
by a lively voyce, in communicating with strangers; and in the judicious consideration
of the fashion of the living one with another. And above all, and principally by Travellers,
and Voyagers in divers Regions, and remote places, whose experience confirmeth the
true Science thereof; and can best draw the anatomy of humane condition. For which,
and other respects, it holdeth true that the heart of man is insatiable being set
upon whatsoever object, his predominant affection listeth; neither may reason find
place in the violent rapt of such passions, for as judgement is seldome compatible
<span class="right-marginnote">[VIII. 342.]</span>with youth, but reserved to old age; so to a unconstant disposition, every accident
is a constellation, by which best thoughts are diversified, &amp; driven from the center
of deepest resolution: whiles contrariwise the sound set man, though by opportunity
altereth his pace, yet still keepeth his way, serveth time for advantage, not for
feare; but as the Sun setteth to rise againe, so he changeth his course, to continue
his purpose. Wherein touching my particular, whether discontent or curiosity drove
me to this second perambulation, it is best reserved <span class="marginnote"><i>The Authors Apology.</i></span>to my owne knowledge: As for the opinion of others, I little care either for their
sweetest temper, or their sowrest censure; for they that hunt after other mens fancies,
goe rather to the market to sell than to buy, and love better to paint the bare fashion
and out-sides of themselves, then to rectify or repaire their owne defects and errours;
wherewith I leave them. Then it is well, if it please me, it is enough; my paines
are mine owne, and not others; and therefore best worthy to judge of my owne labours,
being best knowne to my selfe who dearest bought them: And so to make short this preamble,
or conducing complement I come to the matter it selfe.
</p>
<p>Now as I began my first voyage from Paris, so from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb302" href="#pb302">302</a>]</span>London must I beginne this my second peregrination: whence leaving the Court, the

<p class="first">To flee hence in a word, I measured all the Netherlands with my feete in two moneths
space; the description whereof is so amply set downe by moderne Authors, that it requireth
no more: onely this, for policies, industries, strong Townes, and fortifications,
it is the mirrour of vertue, and the garden of Mars; yea, and the light of all Europe,
that he who hath exactly trade it, may say <span class="marginnote"><i>Weisle taken by Spineola.</i></span>he hath seene the mappe of the whole Universe: And now ascending to Cleve, I came
just to Grave Maurice Campe at Rhiese, as Spineola had taken Weisle; betweene which
Armies for five weekes I had free intercourse, being kindly respected by both the
Generalls: for Spineola set me at his owne table, and I lay in his second Tent nine
nights; the Duke of Newenberg, and Don Pietro di Toledo being there both for the time:
So with the Prince of Orange, with whom I discoursed divers times, was the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb304" href="#pb304">304</a>]</span>Marques of Brandeburg, certaine Nobles, and forraine Ambassadours. All which time,
O how it grieved me <span class="right-marginnote">[VIII. 345.]</span>to see the tyranny of the Spaniards dayly executed upon the distressed Protestants
of Weisle, over whom they domineered like Divells: for these afflicted Cittizens,
being heavily oppressed, by their unsupportable usage, were beleagured with their
friends, when they were held captive by their enemies; and obeying necessity, stayed
their bodies within the walles, though their mindes were without, and intirely with
the assailants.
</p>
<p>Bidding adew to these Armies, and accompanied with a young Gentleman David Bruce,
the L. of Clekmanan his Sonne, whom I conducted to Italy: scarcely had we out-stripd
Rhyneberg (where Collonell Edmond was slaine) a Dutch mile, till we were both robbed
of our cloaks and pocket-moneys, with five souldiers French and Vallones; and that
within a Village, women and children beholding us, but no man to relieve us, they
being with Carts serving Spineolaes Campe.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The fabulous miracles of Culloine.</i></span>Whence the next day approaching Culloine, and bills of change answered, wee visited
the falsly supposed Tombes of the three Kings that came to Bethleem, who as the Romanists
say, lye interred there. O filthy and base absurdnesse for their holy Mother Church
to confirme hellish and erronious leyes; for these Kings came from the East, and from
Chaldea, and not from the North: Or if they wil have them to die there and so buried,
surely this is even such another damnable errour, surpassing tradition, as their wandring
Jew, the Shoomaker of Jerusalem is, of whom in Rome, they have wrot ten thousand fables
and fopperies: from this we visited the 11000. Virgins heads, Martyres, indeed we
saw the Church-walles all indented about with bare sculles, but whose heads they were,
the Lord knoweth; from thence a Gentleman brought us to a Chappell, within a Vineyard,
<span class="right-marginnote">[VIII. 346.]</span>called the Chappell of miracles; the originall whereof was thus. Upon a festivall
day, being Vintage time, there came a Peasant to the Towne, and passing by the Vines
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb305" href="#pb305">305</a>]</span>(as there is a number within the wals) did eate his belly full of the grapes; and
thereafter hearing a Masse, was confessed, and received the Sacrament: And returning
the same way he came, and just where he had eaten the Grapes, <span class="marginnote"><i>A forged and false miracle.</i></span>hee fell a vomiting, and casting up with what hee had eaten the Holy Sacrament, it
straight turned in the likenesse of a new borne Babe, being bright and glorious. Well,
the amazed fellow, run backe and told his Confessour, what was done, and his offence
who had eaten grapes before the Reception of the Eucharist. The Confessour told the
Bishop, where he, and other Prelates comming to the place, and beholding as it were
an Angell, grew astonished.
</p>
<p>In end they wrapped up their little dead god, in a Cambricke vayle, and there buried
it; building this Chappel above the place: where ever since there is a world of leying
miracles done: Loe these are the novelties of Culloine.
</p>
<p>Thence ascending the Rhyne, and coasting Heidleberg, I saluted the Princesse Palatine,
with certayne rare Relickes of the Holy Land. And leaving Mounsieur Bruce there till
my returne, I went for Noorenberg to discover the sixe Germanes death, whom I had
buried in the Desarts, and Grand-Cayre of Ægypt, for the two Barons were subject to
the Marquesse of Hanspauch: Where having met with some of their Brethren, Sisters,
and Kinsmen, and delated to them their deathes, I was presently carryed to their Prince
the Marquesse, to whom I related the whole Circumstances. Whereupon a brother of the
one Baron, and a sister of the other, were instantly invested <span class="right-marginnote">[VIII. 347.]</span>in their Lands; and I likewise, by them all great regarded and rewarded. And after
ten dayes feasting, reviewing Heidleberg, mine associate and I set forward for Helvetia,
or Switzerland.
</p>
<p>This Countrey is divided in thirteene Cantons, sixe whereof are Protestants, and sixe
Papists; the odde Canton being likewise halfe and halfe. The most puissant whereof
is Bierne, whose Territory lying along <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb306" href="#pb306">306</a>]</span>the lake reacheth within a League of Geneve. The people, and their service to most
Christian Princes, are well knowne, being Manly, Martiall and trusty faithfull.
</p>
<p>Here in the Canton of Bierne neere to Urbs, wee went and saw a young Woman, who then
had neyther eate, <span class="marginnote"><i>A woman fasting fourteene yeares.</i></span>nor drunke, nor yet excremented for thirteene yeares, being truely qualified by her
Parents, Friends, Physitians, and other Visitors. She was alwayes Bed-fast, and so
extenuated, that her Anatomised body carryed nought but Sinew, skin, and bones, yet
was she alwayes mindefull of God. And the yeare after this time, her body returned
agayne to the naturall vigour, in appetite and all things: and married a husband,
bearing two children, dyed in the fifth yeare thereafter.
</p>
<p>The day following, we entred Geneve, where sighting the Towne, the chiefe Burgo-masters,
the seven Ministers, and the foure Captaines were all familiarly acquainted with me,
with whom in diverse places, I daily feasted and discoursed. The Ministers one night
propining me with a Bible, newly Translated in the Italian tongue, by one of them
selves borne in Milane, told me there was a Masse-Priest sixe Leagues off, a Curate,
of a Village in Madame du longeviles Countrey, who had gotten in his owne Parish,
three Widdowes, and their three severall Daughters with childe, and all about one
time: and for <span class="right-marginnote">[VIII. 348.]</span>this his Luxurious Cullions was brought to Dijon to be Executed: Desiring me to go
see the manner, the next day (leaving Master Bruce with them) I went hither, and upon
the sequell day, I saw him hanged upon a new Gallowes, as high as a stripad: The three
mothers and their three Daughters were set before him, being Gravidato, whose sorrowfull
hearts, and eye-gushing teares for their sinne and shame, were lamentable to behold:
the incestuous Bugerono, begging still mercy and pardon for dividing their legges,
and opening their wretched Wombes. Lo there is the chastity of the Romish Priests,
who forsooth may not marry, and yet may mis carry themselves in all abhominations,
especially <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb307" href="#pb307">307</a>]</span>in Sodomy, which is their continuall pleasure and practise. Returning to Geneve, and
acquainting the Magistrates with his Confession, for they are great Intelligencers,
I wrot this literal Distich:
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Glance, Glorious Geneve, Gospell-Guiding Gem;
</p>
<p class="line">Great God Governe Good Geneves Ghostly Game.</p>
</div>
<p class="first"><span class="marginnote"><i>The Lake of Geneva, and the River Rhone.</i></span>The Lake of Geneve is sixteene Leagues in length, and two broad, at the South-west
end whereof standeth the Towne, through whose middle runneth the River of Rhone, whose
Head and body beginneth from the Lake among the very houses. The nature of which River
is not unlike to Nylus, for when all other Rivers decrease (being in Summer) this
increaseth. Two reasons proceeding from the excessive Snow that lye upon the Sangalian
and Grisonean Alpes, which cannot melt, till about our longest day, that the force
and face of the Sunne dissolve it. And so ingorging the Lake, it giveth Rhone such
a body, that it is the swiftest River in Europe. The Towne on both sides the flood,
is strongly fortified with rampierd walles, and counter-banding Bulwarkes; the <span class="right-marginnote">[VIII. 349.]</span>Ditch without and about being dry, is mainly pallasaded with wooden stakes, for preventing
of suddain Scallets. Many assaults have this handfull of people suffered by Land and
Water from the Savoyean Duke; the recitall whereof would plunge me in prolixity; and
therefore committing that Light shining Syon, and her Religious Israelites, to the
tuition of the Almighty, I step over the Alpes to Torine.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The first beginning of the Duke of Savoy.</i></span>Here is the residence of the Dukes of Savoy, whose beginning sprung first from the
house of Saxon: For Berold or Berauld, being a neere Cousen to the Emperour Otton
the third, and brother to the Saxon Duke; the Emperour gratified him with these Lands
of Savoy, and parts of Piemont; where he and his Successors continued foure hundred
yeares under the title of Earles: untill the Emperour Sigismond, at the Counsell of
Constance, did Create Amee, the eight Earle of his name Duke. And so <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb308" href="#pb308">308</a>]</span>beginning with him to this present Duke now living, named Charles Emanuel, there have
been only eight Dukes, and some of them of short lives. And yet of all the Christian
Dukes, the most Princely Court is kept heere, for Gallants, Gentry, and Knights.
</p>
<p>At the same time, of my being there, this present Duke had wars with his owne brother
in Law Philip the third, about the Marquesade of Montferrat, and Dutchy of Mantua,
the issue whereof, but retorted to the Duke a redoubling disadvantage; though now
it be gone from the Gonsagaes to the French Duke of Naviers. This Country of Piemont
is a marvailous fruitfull and playne Countrey, and wonderfull populous, like to the
River sides of Arno round about Florence: Insomuch that a Venetian damaunding a Piemont
Cavalier, what Piemont was? Replyed, it was a Towne of three hundred miles <span class="right-marginnote">[VIII. 350.]</span>in circuite, meaning of the Habitations and populosity of the Soyle.
</p>
<p>The rest of the surnames of the Italian Dukes are these, viz. that of Parma is Fernese,
signifying Partridges; that of Modena is Astie, that of Florence de Medicis; that
of Urbine, Francesco Maria, and the last Duke of Mantua, Gonsaga; the Dutchy of Ferrara,
being dissolved, is converted to the Popes patrimony.
</p>
<p>Leaving Piemont, and coasting the sassinous shoare of Genoaes revieroe, I ported Ligorne,
the great Dukes Sea-haven; where I left Mr. Bruce with a Galley Captaine a voluntary
Souldier; and inclining alone to Florence by the <span class="marginnote"><i>A comfortable crosse.</i></span>way at Pestoia, I found a comfortable crosse; for I sighting the market place after
supper, and carrying a French Ponyard in my pocket, the head of it was espied by a
Badgello, Captaine of the Sergeants, who straight gripped me, bore me to prison, and
clapd me in a Dungeon robbing me of all my moneyes and Poneyard; and posting that
night to Florence on the morrow shew the Justice there a Stilleto of his owne: upon
which I was condemned to row in the Gallies for a yeare, else to pay a hundred Duckats:
He stayed there three dayes, in this time was I <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb309" href="#pb309">309</a>]</span>discovered to the governour of Pistoia, a noble Gentleman, and being brought before
him, and acquainting him with the undeserved cruelty of the Badgello: nor that I never
wore a Stilleto, but under pretext of that had robbed mee of three-score and twelve
pieces of gold: Whereupon the Governour perceiving the knavery of the Villaine, and
that he had not acquainted him with my apprehending, to whose place it belonged, he
grew immatulent and forthwith sent post to his Highnesse, shewing him the trueth of
the businesse: Whereupon the Badgello was sent backe <span class="right-marginnote">[VIII. 351.]</span>to the Governour with whom I was domestickly reserved; and being accused before my
face of his roguery, could not deny it: well, my gold and my Poneyard is restored
againe, the Badgello banished the territorie of Pistoia for ever, with his Wife and
Children, and I received in compensation of my abuses, from his Highnesse Chamber
or Treasury there, fifty Florentine Crownes of gold, being modified by the Duke him
selfe; whereat I extolled the knave, that wrought his own wracke in seeking my overthrow,
and brought me such a noble reward.
</p>
<p>Thanking God for this joyfull crosse and approaching Florence, I found one John Browne
there, whose company I imbraced to Sicilia: Whence having privatly past Rome, and
publickly Naples, we footed along the marine by <span class="marginnote"><i>Cousenza in Calabria.</i></span>Salerno, and courting Cousenza, the capitall seate of Calabria where a Vicegerent
remaineth, we reposed there certaine dayes.
</p>
<p>The Towne is of no quantity nor quality, in regard of the obscurenesse and solitarinesse
of the Countrey, the better sort of their Gentry living at Naples: Having left the
lower, and entred the higher Calabria, we arrived at the Bourge of Allavria; and the
next morning traversing close and covert mountaines, twelve miles along, in the midst
of our passage we were beset with foure Bandits and foure Gunnes: To whom holding
up my hand, and imploring for our lives, shewing them mine adventures and former travells,
they unbend their fire-locks, and reading my patent of Jerusalem, uncovered their
heads, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb310" href="#pb310">310</a>]</span>and did me homage, notwithstanding they were absolute murderers: Our lives and liberty
is granted, and for a greater assurance, they tooke us both in to a great thicket
of wood, where their timberd Cabine stood, and there made merry with us in good Wine
and the best cheare <span class="right-marginnote">[VIII. 352.]</span>their sequestrate cottage could afford.
</p>
<p>And now because there were forty more Bandits their companions among these mountaines,
one of themselves for our safeguard, came along with us, and as neare Castellucia
as he durst; making me sweare that I should not shew the Baron of that place of their
privat residence, neither that I met with them at all; which I freely did, and so
gave him many hearty and deserved thanks.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The liberty of Bandits in Calabria.</i></span>These Bandits or men-slayers, will come into any free Towne in the night when they
please, and recovering either a Church or Hospitall, they stay there as they list,
conducing with their friends, their wives, and their affaires; being as safe in these
places as though they had not committed any criminall fact, neither may the power
of Justice reach to them, so long as they keepe themselves within doores.
</p>
<p>This is an auncient liberty which Calabria hath ever retained, and so is through the
most part of all the Spanish Dominions: Having arrived at Castellucia, the Baron thereof
made much of me, and wondred that I had safely past the mountaines, for said he when
I go for Naples, I am forced to go by sea, notwithstanding I have forty in traine.
</p>
<p>The next day in passing Montecilione, the fairest and fruitfullest bounded Bourg in
all Calabria superior; I saw a distectured house; which the people told me had beene
the Schoole, where Dionisius the third and last Tyrant of Sicilia (after his flight
from the Kingdome and Crowne) taught Children privatly nine yeares, ere hee was knowne
to be a King, but a poore Schoolemaster.
</p>
<p>This higher Calabria though mountainous, aboundeth in delicious Wines, fine pastorage,
and exceeding good Silke: The Peasants alwayes commonly here are addicted <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb311" href="#pb311">311</a>]</span><span class="right-marginnote">[VIII. 353.]</span>to eate Onions, whence rose this Proverbe, I Calabrese magniano di Cepoli, the Calabrians
feed upon Onions. Their women weare uncomely habits, being hooded from their browes
to their backes behind, with sixe or seven sundry colours of cloth or stuffe; whose
upper gownes come no further downe than their middle thighes: And their breaches and
stockings being all one, and their legges halfe booted, they looke like the ghostly
Armenian Gargosons.
</p>
<p>I remember in passing this higher Countrey, I found divers Cassales or Terraes, (small
Villages) of certaine <span class="marginnote"><i>Greeke Albaneses fled to Calabria.</i></span>Greekes called Albaneses, whose predecessors had fled from Albania, when the Turke
seased upon Epyre, and this their Province; and was priviledged here to stay by the
Spaniard Philip the first: And though exiled from their naturall Patrimonies, (Omne
solum forti patria est) yet are they exceeding kind to strangers, measuring largely
their owne infranchized fortune, with the voluntary exposement of many unnecessary
Viadants: Declining thence to the marine Bourge of Molino, being by land which we
footed distant from Naples 400. miles; we crossed the narrow Faro, or Sycilian Euripus,
to Messina being two miles broad. Where, when landed, and meeting with a young Scots
Edenburgensen William Wylie, come from Palermo, and bound for Venice, I fastned John
Browne with him to accompany his returne; and on the following day imbarked them both
backe for Calabria.
</p>
<p>And now having followed the Italian saying <span lang="it">Si meglior a star solo come mala accompaniato</span>; It is better for a man to be alone, then in ill company; I traversed the Kingdome
to Trapundie seeking transportation for Affricke, but could get none: And returning
thence overthwart the Iland, I <span class="right-marginnote">[VIII. 354.]</span>call to memory being lodged in the Bourge of Saramutza, belonging to a young Baron,
and being bound the way of Castello Francko eight miles distant and appertaining to
another young Noble youth, I rose and marched by the breach of day; where it was my
lucke halfe way from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb312" href="#pb312">312</a>]</span><span class="marginnote"><i>Two young Barons killed at combat.</i></span>either Towne, to finde both these beardlesse Barons, lying dead, and new killed in
the fields, and their horses standing tyed to a bush beside them; whereat being greatly
moved, I approached them, and perceiving the bodies to be richly cled with silken
Stuffes facily conjectured what they might be: My host having told me the former night,
that these two Barones were at great discord, about the love of a young Noble woman;
and so it was, for they had fought the combat for her sake, and for their owne pride
lay slaine here. For as fire is to Gun powder, so is ambition to the heart of man,
which if it be but touched with selfe-love, mounteth aloft, and never bendeth downeward,
till it be turned into ashes.
</p>
<p>And here it proved for that Ladies sake, that troppo amore turnd to Presto dolore:
Upon which sight, to speake the trueth, I searched both their pockets, and found their
two silken purses full loaden with Spanish Pistolls, whereat my heart sprung for joy,
and taking five rings off their foure hands, I hid them and the two purses in the
ground, halfe a mile beyond this place: And returning againe, leapt to one of their
horses, and came galloping backe to Saramutza; where calling up my host, I told him
the accident; who when he saw the horse gave a shout for sorrow, and running to the
Castle told the Lady the Barons Mother: where in a moment, shee, her children, and
the whole Towne runne all with me to the place, some cled, some naked, some on foote,
and some on horse: where, <span class="right-marginnote">[VIII. 355.]</span>when come grievous was it to behold their woefull and sad lamentations. I thus seeing
them all madde and distracted of their wits with sorrow, left them without good-night:
And comming to my Treasure, made speedy way to Castello Franco, where bearing them
the like newes, brought them all to the like distraction and flight of feet.
</p>
<p>Well, in the mutability of time there is aye some fortune falleth by accident, whether
lawfull or not, I will not question, it was now mine that was last theirs, and to
save the thing that was not lost, I travailed that day thirty miles further to Terra
nova. Whence the next morning <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb313" href="#pb313">313</a>]</span>beeing earely imbarked for Malta, and there safely Landed; <span class="marginnote"><i>A London ship called the Matthew.</i></span>I met with a ship of London called the Mathew, bound for Constantinople lying in the
Roade where indeede with the Company I made merry a shoare for three dayes, and especially
with one George Clarke their Burser, who striving to plant in my braines a Maltezan
Vineyard, had almost perished his owne life.
</p>
<p>Upon the fourth day, they hoysing sayle, and I staying a shoare, it was my good lucke
within eight dayes to find a French ship of Tolon come from the Levante, and bound
for Tunneis by the way in going home. With whom desirously consorted, within three
dayes we touched at our intended Port. And now to reckon the gold that I found in
the aforesayd purses, it amounted to three hundred and odde double Pistols; and their
Rings being set with Dyamonds, were valued to a hundred Chickens of Malta, eight shillings
the peece, which I dispatched for lesser: But the gold was my best second, which like
Homers Iliades under Alexanders pillow, was my continuall vade Mecum.
</p>
<p>Tunneis is the Capitall seate of its owne Territory, and <span class="right-marginnote">[VIII. 356.]</span>of all the East and lower Barbary, containing ten thousand fire-houses: And it is
the place where old Carthage stood, that was builded by the Tyrians and Phenicians
of the Holy Land, some three score twelve yeares before Rome, and had twenty miles
in circuit: Which City in these times, was the soveraigne Queene of Affrick, and the
onely envy, and predominant malice of the Romanes, being more then Romes rivall mate,
in greatnesse, glory, and dominion: Neverthelesse in end, it was taken, sackt, and
burnt by Scipio the Affrican Romane, some sixe hundred and two yeares after Rome was
first founded, and her ruines and large Territories without, made subject to the ambition
of Rome.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The divers plantations of Carthage.</i></span>After which detriment, desolate Carthage was rebuilded by Cæsar, and a Collony of
Italians transported there, flourished for a time, till it was destroyed and overrunne
by the Gothes and Vandales: And lastly subdued by the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb314" href="#pb314">314</a>]</span>Sarazens and Moores, it was by them transmitted to the Turkish power, who now is Maister
of it, being no way answerable to the sixe part of the greatnes it had before. This
Towne is situate in the bottome of a Creeke, where the Sea for a mile having cut the
bosome of the Land, maketh a large and safe resting place for ships and galleyes.
Which Haven and Towne is secured from Sea invasions, by the great and strong Fortresse
of Galetto, builded on a high Promontore, that imbraceth the Sea, and commandeth the
mouth of the Bay; wherein a Turkish Bassaw, and a strong Garrison of Souldiers remaine:
the Fort it selfe being well provided with armes, men, Artillery and munition.
</p>
<p>The Kingdome of Tunneis comprehended once the whole Countrey that the auncients called
properly Affrick <span class="right-marginnote">[VIII. 357.]</span>or little Affrick, being the old Numidia, and was divided then in these five Provinces,
Bugia, Constantino, that of Tunneis, Tripoly, and Ezzebba. In the Towne of Bugia,
lying halfe way twixt Tunneis and Algeir, and 40. leagues from either being now called
Arradetz, there was auncient beautifull Temples, Colledges, magnifick buildings, Hospitals,
and Convents after their fashion: but the Towne being taken, and razed Anno 1508.
by Peter King of Navarre, it hath remained ever since without beauty or ornament,
save a few rusticke Inhabitants.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The marine provinces twixt Tunneis and Algier.</i></span>The province of Constantine, lyeth twixt Tunneis and Bugia; the Towne Constantine,
now Abirouh, being Capitall, and was surnamed Cortes and Julia: It is begirded with
Rockes, and auncient walles contayning eight hundred fire-houses, wherein are the
relicts of an Arke triumphant, formerly built by the Romanes; and in this Province
sixteene leagues within land, was the Towne of Hippo, now Bosen, whereof St. Augustine
was Bishop.
</p>
<p>The Territory of Tunneis, lyeth betweene the borders of Abirouh Westward, and the
limits of Tripoly Eastward, being of length foure score miles: and on this Sea-coast
lyeth the Towne Biserta, adorned with a commodious <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb315" href="#pb315">315</a>]</span>Haven, and sixe Gallies, the most scelerate of condition, and celerious in flying
or following of all the cursares in Turky: Tripoly in Barbary, (commonly called so)
was once drowned by the Sea, but now its situation was transported safely a little
more Southward; which sometimes was beautified with Merchants of Genoa, Ragusa, and
Venice, but now become a den of theeves, and Sea-Pirats, and so are all the marine
Townes, twixt Ægypt and Morocco.
</p>
<p>The last Province of the kingdom of Numidia, is <span class="right-marginnote">[VIII. 358.]</span>Ezzebba lying East from Tripoly, and confining with Cyreno a pendicle of Ægipt: The
chiefest part whereof is Messaicke being twenty foure Leagues from Tripoly, contayning
many Villages, and Townes on the playnes and Mountaynes, abounding in Silkes, Cornes,
and diverse Fruites.
</p>
<p>All these five Maritine Provinces, have but narrow Inlands, not advancing South-ward
from the Sea coast above forty miles. Here in Tunneis I met with our <span class="marginnote"><i>An English Pyrat Captaine Waird.</i></span>English Captayne, generall Waird, once a great Pyrat, and Commaunder at Sea; who in
despight of his denied acceptance in England, had turned Turke, and built there a
faire Palace, beautified with rich Marble and Alabaster stones: With whom I found
Domesticke, some fifteene circumcised English Runagates, whose lives and Countenances
were both alike, even as desperate as disdainfull. Yet old Waird their maister was
placable, and joyned me safely with a passing Land conduct to Algiere; yea, and diverse
times in my ten dayes staying there, I dyned and supped with him, but lay aboord in
the French shippe.
</p>
<p>At last having obtayned my pasport from the Bassaw there, and surety taken for my
life and moneyes, I imbraced the Land way with this Conduct, consisting of forty Moores,
and a hundred Camels loaden with Silkes, Dimmeteis, and other Commodities, traversing
the aforesayd Regions of Abirouh, and Arradetz. In all which way (lying nightly in
a Tent) I found a pleasant and fruitfull Country, abounding in Wines, Rye, Barly,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb316" href="#pb316">316</a>]</span>Wheate, and all kinde of fruites, with innumerable villages, and so infinitely peopled,
that it made me wish there had beene none at all; otherwise that they had beene Christians,
and so more civill.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[VIII. 359.]</span>The greatest enemy this journey designed mee, was the Sunne, whose exceeding heate
was intollerable to indure, being in September Anno 1615. But for provision of Water,
Wine, and Victuals wee had abundance. Upon the seaventh day of our course, wee entred
in the <span class="marginnote"><i>Tremizen in Barbary.</i></span>Countrey of Tremizen, formerly Mauritanea Cæsarea: This Kingdome hath to the West
Mauritanea Tingitana, contayning the Empire of Morocco and Fez. On the South Gotulia
or Desartuous Numidia. On the East with the Rivers of Muluia and Amphlaga, the Marches
of Arradetz. And on the North the Sea Mediterren, opposite to Sardinia. The Countrey
is in length from the East to the West, some twenty five of their courses, and of
our miles about three hundred; and of breadth betweene the Sea and Gotulia, no more
than thirty English miles.
</p>
<p>This copious Kingdome in all things, hath beene oft and ever molested with the Numidian
Sarazens, or bastard Arabs, who falling downe from the Mountaines, do runne their
carriere at random upon the ground-toyled Moores, to satisfie their needy and greedy
desires. Tremizen or Telensim, had of old foure Provinces, but now onely two <span class="marginnote"><i>The Towne of Tremizen decayed with Warres.</i></span>its owne Territory, and that of Algier: Whose capitall Towne being too cognominated
Tremizen, contayned once eighteene thousand fire houses. But in regard of Josephus
King or Fez, who besieged it seaven yeares, over-mastering it and then subdued by
Charles the fifth, and likewise the Turkes investion of it, and finally because of
the long warres, twixt the Seriff or King there, and the Turke; it is become a great
deale lesser and almost disinhabited, and the most part of that Countrey subject to
the authority of the Bassaw of Algier.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[VIII. 360.]</span>At last upon the twelfth day of our leaving Tunneis, having arrived at Algier, and
abandoning my Conduct <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb317" href="#pb317">317</a>]</span>with a good respect, I stayed in a Spaniards house, turned Runagate, who kept a roguish
Taverne, and a ground planked Hospitality. In all this way of twelve score miles,
I payed no Tribute, neyther had I any eminent perrill, the Country being peaceable,
though the people uncivill.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The theevish Towne of Algier.</i></span>This Towne of Algier, was formerly under subjection to the Kingdome of Tremizen, but
because of insupportable charges it revolted, and rendered to the King of Arradetz
or Bugia: Afterwards it was under the King of Spaine, from whom Barbarossa did take
it Anno 1515. being now under the Turke, and is situate upon the pendicles of a flat
devalling height, and standeth triangular. The Marine side whereof is strongly fortified,
with earth-back&#x2019;d walles, Bulwarkes, and Artillery, but the semi-squared land-walles,
are of small importance, and easily to be surprised; and three miles in circuite,
contayning some thirty thousand persons.
</p>
<p>There is a Turkish Bashaw here, and a strong Garrison of sixe thousand Janizaries,
with two hundred Cursary ships or Pyrats who ever preying upon Christian Commercers,
by their continuall spoyles and prises, have made the divelish Towne wonderfull rich;
and become the inveterate enemy of Christendome; being now a Kingdome of it selfe,
and in length from East to West betweene the Townes Terracot and Guargola, some sixe
score miles. It hath a long reaching mould in the Sea, that maketh a safe harbor for
their ships agaynst Northerly windes, which on that Coast are deadly dangerous. At
this time, the greatest part of the Towne were fled to the mountaynes to <span class="right-marginnote">[VIII. 361.]</span>shun the parching heate that beateth violently on the Plaines, and Sea-shore; so doe
all the maritine Townes of Barbary the like every Sommer, for the moneths July, August,
and September: which then being left halfe naked of defence, it were the onely time
for Christianes to invade or surprise their Townes.
</p>
<p>I found here abundance of slaves, most of them Spaniards, whom they dayly constraine
within Towne to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb318" href="#pb318">318</a>]</span>beare all manner of burdens here and there, and without Towne to drudge in the fields,
amongst their Vines and Cornes, and other toyling labours, abusing them still with
buffets and bastinadoes as their perverstnesse listeth: Neither durst I leave my lodging,
unlesse I had three or foure Christian slaves to guide me, and guard me too from scelerate
vulgars: who beare no respect to any stranger nor free Franck. <span class="marginnote"><i>A naturall sublime policy.</i></span>Here I remarked a wonderfull policy in the Turkish state, concerning these thiftuous
and rapinous Townes of Barbary; who as they are ordained ever to plague and prey upon
the Spaniard, yet under that colour they licentiat them to make havock and seaze upon
all other Christiane ships, goods, and persons as they please, the French Nation excepted:
And so they doe notwithstanding of our several Ambassadours lying at Constantinople,
who rather stay there as Mungrells than absolute Ambassadours: for why should Christian
Princes meditate for peace and commerce with the Turke, when theirs, with his subjects
the Barbarian Moores have no safety; they being obedient to his lawes, and over-ruled
by Bassawes, as well as these are of Asia and Easterne Europe: from which I gather,
as from all other like examples, that there is a more sublime over-mastering policy,
subtility, and provident foresight, in meere naturall men as Turkes be, then in our
best Grandeurs, for all their Sciences, &amp; schoole studies can either perceive or <span class="right-marginnote">[VIII. 362.]</span>perform farre less prosecute. To which avowed dangers if any small ship, ruled by
rash fellowes, should adventure within the straites, as too many English doe, beeing
unable and unprovided for defence; and so are taken &amp; Captivated, and afterward redeemed
by Contributions over the Land: I justly affirme it, they deserve rather to be punished,
and remayne there in punishment, then any reliefe or redemption to be wrought for
them, who will nakedly hazard themselves in knowne perrils, without Ordonance, munition,
and a burdenable ship.
</p>
<p>But reverting to my purpose, the marine Provinces which lye betweene Ægypt and Sewty,
over agaynst <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb319" href="#pb319">319</a>]</span><span class="marginnote"><i>The Barbarian Provinces twixt Egypt and Gibelterre.</i></span>Gibelterre being the Straits, are these; Cyrene, Barca Marmorica, Ezzeba, the Trypolian
Jurisdiction, the Kingdomes of Tunneis, Abirouh, Arradetz, Tremizen, Algier, and a
part of Fez; extending to two thousand and three hundred Maritine miles: All which,
by ignorant Sea-men, and ruvide Moores is tearmed Barbary, who can not distinguish
parts nor provinces, but even as the Orientall Turkes doe, that denominate all Asia
minor, under the name Carmania, and know no further of their ancient nor particular
titles.
</p>
<p>Now as concerning their Customes, it is the fashion of all these Barbarian Moores,
in marrying of their wives, that after the Bridegroome and the Bride are inrolled
by their Totsecks or Priests in the Mosque before the Parents of each party, and the
Bride presently brought home to the house of her Husband, accompanied with al their
Friends, Musicke, and Revelling: He immediatly withdraweth her to a private Chamber,
having onely one old woman standing by them in a corner of the Roome: where hee lying
with the Bride, and shee being found a Mayde, <span class="right-marginnote">[VIII. 363.]</span>by a certayne cloath layd under her privy place, which being by the old Hagge drawne
out, and found sprinkled with spots of blood shee presenteth it first to him, as a
token of virginity; and then forthwith runneth through the house, among all the friends
of the new married couple, crying with a loud voyce, and carrying the bloody napkin
in her hand, the Virgine-bride is broken up; whereat they all rejoyce, giving rewards
and good cheare to the Cryer: <span class="marginnote"><i>The tryall of Moorish Brides.</i></span>But if the bride be not found a Mayd, then he returneth her backe unto her Parents
which they accompt as an immortall shame, and the nuptiall feast, and all the <span class="corr" id="xd29e7478" title="Source: asistants">assistants</span> thereunto, are suddenly dismissed: But if a Virgine, the banquet continueth all the
first day, with great cheare, dancings, revellings, with Musicall Instruments of divers
sorts.
</p>
<p>The second night is onely the feast of women for both parties; and the third banquet
is made on the seventh day after the nuptiall, the provision of which the father of
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb320" href="#pb320">320</a>]</span>Bride sendeth to the house of his new sonne in law: where after this banquet, and
the seventh day, in the next morning the <span class="corr" id="xd29e7489" title="Source: Bridegroeme">Bridegroome</span> goeth then abroad from his house (which hee doth not till the aforesayd time) unto
the market place, where he buyeth a number of fish to carry with him to his dwelling,
as a signe of good lucke, it being an auncient custome through the most part of all
the Notherne Affrick.
</p>
<p>The men and women at such meetings dance a part, each of them having their own Musicke
and orders of merriment.
</p>
<p>They have also a custome <span class="corr" id="xd29e7495" title="Source: when that">that when</span> Infants beginne to breed teeth, their Parents will make a solemne feast to all the
Children of the Towne, with divers ceremonies; which custome they reserve yet, in
divers parts of Italy.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[VIII. 364.]</span>The women through all Barbary, weare abundance of Bracelets on their armes, and Rings
in their eares, but not through the nose and lips as the Ægyptians doe; and turne
also the nayles of their hands and feete to red, accounting it a base thing to see
a white naile: The men here for the most part, are the best Archers, and Horse-men
that are in Affrick, and take great pleasure in breeding of their Barbes: So are they
both active and couragious, and very desperate in all their attempts, being all of
the Mahometanicall Religion, though more ignorant thereof than the Turkes: some whereof
are subject to the Turke, some to the Emperour of Morocco, and some to their owne
barbarous Princes.
</p>
<p>And now it was my fortune here in Algier, after 12. <span class="marginnote"><i>Monsieur Chatteline a French Lapidator.</i></span>dayes abode, to meete with a French Lapidator, Monsieur Chatteline borne in Aise du
Provance, who intending to visit Fez, joyned company with me, and we with certaine
Merchants of Algier that were going hither: being in all 30. passengers, with two
Jannizaries and a Dragoman.
</p>
<p>Whence advancing our way, some on Mules, and some on foote, with Asses carrying our
baggage and provision; we left the marine Townes of Saly and Tituana, far to the West
on our right hand, and facing the in-land wee <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb321" href="#pb321">321</a>]</span>marched for three dayes through a fruitfull and populous soyle: And although the peoples
barbarous and disdainefull countenances were awfull, yet we two went still free of
tributs, as not being a thing with them accustomary, to execute exaction on Francks
as the Turkes and Moores do in Asia, neither understood they what wee were, being
cled with company, and after their fashion: save onely that nature had set a fairer
stamp on my face, than theirs, which oft I wished had beene as blacke as their uglines.
<span class="right-marginnote">[VIII. 365.]</span>In this misculat journeying of paine &amp; pleasure we found every where strong Wines,
abundance of excellent bread, and the best, and greatest Hens bred on the earth, with
plenty of Figges, Fruits, Olives, and delicious oyle, yea, and innumerable Villages,
the houses whereof are all builded with mudde, and platformed on their tops; and so
are they in Asia, and all Affrick over.
</p>
<p>Upon the fourth day having past the Plaines, we entered in a hilly Countrey, yet pastorable;
where I beheld here and there clouds of Tents, filled with maritine people, that were
fled hither from the Sea coast for the fresh and cooling ayre.
</p>
<p>And upon these pleasant and umbragious heights, I saw the fields overcled with flocks
of Sheepe and Goats: which Sheepe are wondrous great, having from their rumpes and
hips, broad and thicke tayles growing, and hanging to the ground, some whereof when
sold, will weigh 16. 18. or 20. pounds weight, and upwards. Here among the mountaines,
our company knowing well the Countrey, tooke a great advantage of the way, and on
the seventh day in the morning, <span class="marginnote"><i>Mine arrival at Fez.</i></span>wee arrived at the great Towne of Fez: where the French man and I were conducted by
some of our company to a great Moorish Inne or Taverne: &amp; there received, we were
as kindly &amp; respectively used, as ever I was in any part of the Turks Dominions, being
now out of them, &amp; in the Empire of Morocco.
</p>
<p>This City of Fez is situate upon the bodies and twice double devalling faces of two
hills, like to Grenada in Andelosia in Spaine; the intervale, or low valley betweene
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb322" href="#pb322">322</a>]</span>both (through which the torride River of Marraheba runneth Southward) being the Center
and chiefest place, is the most beautifull and populous part of the City; the situation
of which, and of the whole, is just set under the Tropick of Cancer.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[VIII. 366.]</span>Over which River, and in this bottome, there are three score and seaven Bridges of
stone and Timber, each of them being a passage for open streetes on both sides. The
intervayle consisteth of two miles in length, and halfe a mile broad; wherein, besides
five Chereaffs or Market places, there are great Palaces, magnificke Mosquees, <span class="marginnote"><i>Great Colledges and Hospitalls.</i></span>Colledges, Hospitals, and a hundred Palatiat Tavernes, the worst whereof, may lodge
a Monarchicke trayne: Most part of all which buildings, are three and foure stories
high, adorned with large and open Windowes, long Galleries, spacious Chambers, and
flat tectures or square platformes.
</p>
<p>The streetes being covered above, twixt these plaine-set Fabrickes, have large Lights
cut through the tectur&#x2019;d tops every where; in whose lower shoppes or Roomes are infinite
Merchandize, and Ware of all sorts to bee sold.
</p>
<p>The people of both kindes are cloathed in long breeches and bare Ancles, with red
or yellow shooes shod with Iron on the Heeles, and on the Toes with white Horne; and
weare on their bodies long Robes of Linning or Dimmety, and silken Wast-coates of
diverse Colours: The behaviour of the Vulgars being far more civill toward Strangers
then at Constantinople; or else where in all Turkey.
</p>
<p>The Women here go unmasked abroad, wearing on their heads, broad, and round Capes,
made of Straw or small Reedes, to shade their faces from the Sunne; and damnable Libidinous,
beeing prepared both wayes to satisfie the lust of their Luxurious Villaines; neyther
are they so strictly kept as the Turkish Women, marching where they please.
</p>

</div><p>
</p>
<p>There are some twelve thousand allowed Brothell-houses <span class="right-marginnote">[VIII. 367.]</span>in this Towne, the Courtezans being neatly kept, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb323" href="#pb323">323</a>]</span>and weekely well looked to by Physitians; but worst of all, in the Summer time, they
openly Lycentiat three thousand common Stewes of Sodomiticall boyes: Nay I have seene
at mid-day, in the very Market places, the Moores buggering these filthy Carrions,
and without shame or punishment go freely away.
</p>
<p>There are severall Seates of Justice heere (though none to vindicate beastlinesse)
occupied by Cadeis and Sanzackes, which twice a Weeke heare all differences and complaints:
their chiefe Seriff, or Vicegerent, being sent from Morocco, is returned hither agayne
every third yeare.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The beauty and greatnes of Fez.</i></span>The two Hills on both sides the planur&#x2019;d Citty, East, and West, are over-cled with
streetes and Houses of two stories high, beeing beautified also with delicate Gardens,
and on their extreame devalling parts, with numbers of Mosquees and Watch-towers:
On which heights, and round about the Towne, there stand some three hundred Wind-mils;
most part whereof pertayne to the Mosques, and the two magnifick Colledges erected
for education of Children, in the Mahometanicall Law<span class="corr" id="xd29e7564" title="Source: ,">.</span>
</p>
<p>One of which Accademies, cost the King Habahennor in building of it, foure hundred
and three score thousand Duckets. Jacob sonne to Abdulach the first King of the Families
of Meennons, divided Fez in three parts, and with three severall Walles, though now
invironed with onely one, and that broken downe in sundry parts.
</p>
<p>The chiefest Mosque in it, is called Mammo-Currarad, signifying the glory of Mahomet,
being an Italian mile in Compasse, and beautified with seventeene high ground Steeples,
besides Turrets and Towers: having thirty foure <span class="right-marginnote">[VIII. 368.]</span>entring Doores; beeing supported within, and by the <span class="marginnote"><i>The modell of the great City of Fez.</i></span>length, with forty eight pillars, and some twenty three Ranges of pillars in breadth,
besides many Iles, Quires, and circulary Rotundoes: Every Pillar having a Lampe of
Oyle burning thereat; where there, and through the <span class="right-marginnote">[VIII. 369.]</span>whole Mosque, there are every night nine hundred Lamps lighted; and to maintaine them,
and a hundred Totsecks and preaching Talsumans, the rent of it extendeth to two <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb324" href="#pb324">324</a>]</span>hundred Duccats a day: Neverthelesse there are in the City besides it, more then foure
hundred and threescore <span class="marginnote"><i>The magnifick Mosque of Fez.</i></span>Mosquees; fifty whereof are well benefited and superbiously decored within and without,
with glorious and extraordinary workmanship, whose rooffes within are all Mosaick
worke, and curiously indented with Gold, and the walles and pillars being of grey
Marble, interlarded with white Alabaster, and so is the chiefe Mosque too in which
Monsieur Chatteline and I had three sundry recourses accompanied with our Moorish
hoste, who from their Priests had procured that licence for us. This City aboundeth
in all manner of provision fit for man or beast, &amp; is the goodliest place of all North
Affrick, contayning a hundred and twenty thousand fire-houses, and in them a million
of soules: Truely this is a world for a City, and may rather second Grand Caire, than
subjoyne it selfe to Constantinople, being farre superior in greatnesse with Aleppo:
For these are the foure greatest Cities, that ever I saw in the world, either at home
or abroad.
</p>
<p>The Cittizens here are very modest and zealous at their divine services, but great
dauncers and revellers on their solemne festivall dayes, wherein they have Bull-beating,
Maskerats, singing of rimes, and processions of Priests. The Moores in times past
of Fez and Morocco, had divers excellent personages, well learned, and very civill;
for amongst the Kings Mahometan one can not praise too much the Kings Almansor, Maunon,
and Hucceph, being most excellent men in their superstition.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[VIII. 370.]</span>In whose times flourished the most famous medicines, and Philosophers that were among
the Pagans, as A Vicenne, Rasis, Albumazar, Averroes, &amp;c. with other great numbers
maintained by the Kings of Morocco, that then were Masters of all Barbary and Spaine:
As in Spaine may be seene yet, (though now fallen in decay) a great number of their
Colledges, shewing they were great lovers of their Religion and Doctrine, and are
so to this day, save onely in their drinking of Wine forbidden by their Alcoran. They
were great devisers too of gallant sportings, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb325" href="#pb325">325</a>]</span>exercises, turnaments, and Bull-beating, which Spayne retaineth to this time; yea,
and the Romanes did learne, and follow many of them.
</p>
<p>Here in Fez there be a great number of Poets, that make Songs on divers subjects,
especially of Love, and Lovers, whom they openly name in their rimes, without <span class="marginnote"><i>Poets among Barbarians in great request.</i></span>rebuke or shame: All which Poets once every yeare, agane Mahomets birth-day, make
rimes to his praise; meanewhile in the after noone of that festivall day, the whole
Poets assembling in the market place, there is a Dasked chayre prepared for them,
whereon they mount one after another to recite their verses in audience of all the
people; and who by them is judged to be best, is esteemed all that yeare above the
rest, having this Epithite the Prince of Poets, and is by the Vicegerent and Towne
rewarded; But in the time of the Maennon Kings, the Prince on that day in his owne
Pallace did conveine the whole Cittizens, in whose presence he made a solemne feast
to all the best Poets; causing every one of them to recite the praise of Mahomet before
his face, standing on a high scaffold: And to him that was thought to excell the rest,
the King gave him 100. Sultans of gold, an horse, a woman slave, <span class="right-marginnote">[VIII. 371.]</span>&amp; the long Robe that was about him for the time: And to each one of the rest he caused
give fifty Sultans, so that every one should have some recompense for their paines:
Indeed a worthy observance; and would to God it were now the custome of our Europian
Princes to doe the like, and especially of this Ile, then would bravest wits, and
quickest braines, studdy and strive to show the exquisit ingeniosity of their best
styles, and pregnant invention, which now is ecclipsed, and smotherd downe, because
now a dayes, there is neither regard nor reward for such excellent Pen-men. Fez was
aunciently named Sylda, whose Kingdome hath Atlas to the South, the River of Burdraga
to the East, and Tremizen: Morocco to the West: And the confynes of Guargula, and
a part of the Sea to the North: Having spent in Fez 17. dayes, in all which time,
we daily conversed with some Christian Abasines, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb326" href="#pb326">326</a>]</span><span class="marginnote"><i>Heragens or Ethiopian Negroes.</i></span>Heragenes, or Æthiopian Nigroes, some whereof were Merchands, and some religious;
and Monsieur Chattelines businesse not effected, seeking Diamonds and precious stones
to buy; was seriously advised by them, to goe for Arracon, a great Towne on the Frontiers
of the Northerne Æthiopia: where he would finde abundance of such at an easie rate,
giving him a perfit direction for his passage hither being 30. daies journey: he concluded
with their counsell his resolution, and perswading me to the same intention, I yeeld,
being over-mastred with the greedy desire of more sights.
</p>
<p>Meanewhile for our conduct, we hire a Dragoman Moore that spoke Italiens to be our
Interpreter, and with him a Tent, and two Moorish drudges to guide, guard, &amp; serve
us by the way of fifty eight Sultans for gold, eighteene pounds foure shillings English:
having sixe of their Kinsmen fast bound to a Sanzak or Justice, for our lives, liberties,
and moneyes.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[VIII. 372.]</span>Hereupon having provided our selves, with all necessary things, and a Mule to carry
our Victuals, Water and Baggage, we discharged our conscionable Hostage, at twenty
Aspers a day the man, being thirty foure shillings to each of us; and were brought
on our way, by the aforesayd Christian Heragenes some foure Leagues. Where having
left them with dutifull thankes, wee set forward in our journey, and for seaven dayes
together wee were not violently molested by any thing, save intollerable heate, finding
tented people and scattered Villages all the way.
</p>
<p>The eight day, the way being fastidious and Rockey, <span class="marginnote"><i>Chatteline the French Lapidator taken sicke.</i></span>and Chatteline on foot, he succumb&#x2019;d, and could not subsist, not beeing used to pedestriall
travayle; and for our better speed and his reliefe, wee mounted him aloft on the top
of our baggage. At last arriving at Ahetzo (where we reposed) being the furthest and
South-most Towne of the Kingdome of Fez, composed of a thousand fire-houses, well
fortified with Walles, and a Garrison of Moores in it, subject to the Emperour of
Morocco: the French-man <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb327" href="#pb327">327</a>]</span>long or day, fell sicke of a burning Feaver: Whereuppon wee stayed five dayes expecting
his health, which growing worse and worse, and hee mindfull to returne, which I would
not: I left him in safe custody, and one of our Drudges to attend him till Fez. And
bearing the charges of the other two, according to the former condition: I set forward
for my purpose, which ere long turned to sad Repentance.
</p>
<p>Leaving Ahetzo behind us, and entring the Countrey of the Agaroes, we found the best
inhabitants halfe cled, the Vulgars naked, the Countrey voyd of Villages, Rivers,
or Cultivage: but the soyle rich in Bestiall, abounding in <span class="right-marginnote">[VIII. 373.]</span>Sheep, Goates, Camels, Dromidores, and passing good horses: Having an Emeere of their
owne, being subject to none, but to his owne passions, and them to the disposition
of his scelerate nature; yet hee, and they had a bastard show of Mahometanicall Religion:
Their Bestiall are watered with sources, and the pastorable fields, with the nightly
Serene, and themselves with the Watrish concavity of the earth. In our sixe dayes
toyle, traversing this Countrey, we had many troubles and snarlings from these Savages,
who sometimes over-laboured us with Bastinadoes, and were still inquirous what I was,
and whether I went; yea, and enough for the Dragoman to save my life and liberty.
</p>
<p>Having past the perverstnesse of this calamity, upon the seaventh day, wee rancountred
with another soyle, <span class="marginnote"><i>The Tribe of the Hagans or Jamnites.</i></span>and worser tribe of the Hagans or Jamnites, most part whereof were white Moores, a
people more uglye then the Nigroes, yet some of the better sort had their members
covered, but of condition farre more wicked then the former.
</p>
<p>They are ruled by a Seriff, whose Guard is composed of women, and young Balars, pages;
seeming rather to live without Religion, then acknowledging any kinde of Deity. Here
my Dragoman, doubting of his passage, and the difficilnesse of the Countrey, which
arose from his ignorantnesse thereof, was inforced to hyre a Hagan <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb328" href="#pb328">328</a>]</span>guide, to bring us to the province of Abadud, bordering with Æthiopia. But by your
leave, our guide having led us for five dayes together South-eastward, and almost
contrary to our purpose: in the sixt night of our Repose, he stole away, eyther for
feare or falshood, mistaking our journey, or deceiving us for despight, the halfe
of his Wages being payed him before. Well, the Villaine gone, <span class="right-marginnote">[VIII. 374.]</span>and my Dragoman the next day continuing our faces, in the same Arte, wee were long
or night involved in a dis-inhabited Country, being Desartuous and dangerous for Wilde
beasts, and full of Mountaynes. Pitching our Tent neare to a Rocke, we burnt all that
night shrubs of Tara, to affright the Beasts of all kinds, and so did we every night
of that wofull wandring, which flaming light <span class="right-marginnote">[VIII. 375.]</span>their nature cannot abide. Day come, and our comfort yet fresh, we sought further
in, thinking to finde people and Tents to relieve us with Victuales, and informe us
of the Countrey, but we found none, neither seven daies thereafter. The matter growing
hard, and our victuals and water done, we were forced to relye upon Tobacco, and to
drinke our owne wayning pisse, for the time aforesayd.
</p>
<p>The Soyle we daily traced, was covered with hard and soft Sands, and them full of
Serpents, being interlarded with Rockey heights, faced with Caves and Dens: the very
habitacle of Wilde beasts, whose hollow cryes, as we heard in the night, so we too
often sighted their bodies in the <span class="marginnote"><i>The Wilde Beasts of the Libian Desarts.</i></span>day, especially Jackals, Beares, and Boares, and sometimes Cymbers, Tygers, and Leopards,
agaynst whom in the day time if they approached us, we eyther shot off a Harquebuse,
or else flashed some powder in the Ayre; the smell whereof, no ravenous beast can
abide.
</p>
<p>This vast Wildernesse is a part of the Berdoans Countrey, one of the foure tribes
of the olde Lybians, the Sabuncks, the Carmines, and the Southerne Garolines, being
the other three. And now to helpe the expression of my grievous distresse and miseries,
my Muse must lament the rest.

<p class="first">But to shorten my Discourse, of barren Wildernesses, supposed to be a part of the
Lybian Desarts, my Dragoman <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb330" href="#pb330">330</a>]</span>upon the fourth day of our seaven being there, falling in despaire, and wondring to
see me indure such heate, <span class="right-marginnote">[VIII. 377.]</span>such hunger, and such toyle, did threaten mee with death, to make me seeke backe for
our nearest refuge: Whereupon holding our course North-east, my compasse-Dyall being
our guide, we rancountred earely on the eight day, with nine hundred Savages, naked
Lybian Sabunks: five hundred whereof, were women armed with Bowes and Arrowes; who
with their complices, the former night had put to the sword, three hundred Berdoanes,
their neighbour tribe: carrying away above sixe thousand Sheepe and Goats besides
other bestiall: from whom after our sight of their Emeere or Prince, we had first
liberty of life, and then reliefe of food; for he came up in the Reare, with a hundred
Horse-men charged with halfe Pikes, headed at <span class="marginnote"><i>The prince of the Sabuncks apparrell.</i></span>both ends with sharpe Steele: The person of their Prince was onely clothed from his
breasts downe to his middle thigh with a Crimson vayle of Silke, hanging on his naked
shoulders with coloured Ribans, and on his head a party coloured Shash set like a
Garland: Both his knees were bare, so were his ancles, the calves of his legges being
girded with Crimson Silke, and on his feet yellow shooes; his beard was like his face,
burnt with the Sun, and his age like to my owne, of 33. yeares, his Religion is damnable,
so is his life, for hee and all the foure tribes of Lybia worship onely for their
God, Garlick, having Altars, Priests, and superstitious rites annexed to it: Thinking
Garlicke, being strong of it selfe, and the most part of their food, to have a soveraigne
vertue in a herball Deity. All his Courtiers were starke naked saving his Page, who
was even covered like to the King his Master.
</p>
<p>And now having dismissed his Army for the way, and falling in a houres parley with
us at his departure, he propyned me with his Bowe, &amp; a Quiver of Arrowes, which afterward,
I presented to his Majesty, then Prince.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[VIII. 378.]</span>There is a merry secret heere concerning the women, which often I recited to King
James of Blessed memory, showing him also three Certificates of this my Desartuous
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb331" href="#pb331">331</a>]</span>wandring: one of which was confirmed by English Waird at Tunneis upon the Dragomans
Report; though now they with all my other Patents are lost, in the Inquisition of
Malaga. This former savage Prince sent a Guide with us for foure dayes journey, the
condition of his mans Wages being made by himselfe, and franckly advised us that Tunneis
was our best and nearest Recourse. Which being forcibly considered, I was constrayned
to renew my bargaine agayne with the Dragoman, at the rate of forty five Sultans of
gold, to bring me safely hither.
</p>
<p>This Sabunck Guide, to whom I gave five Sultans, thirty five shillings, brought us
through the most Habitable vallies, and best cled passages of the Countrey with Tents:
where every day once we found Water, Bread, Garlicke and Onions, and sometimes Hennes
at twenty Aspers the peece, two shillings; which we would Rost, or scorch dry (if
trueth may have credite) at the very face of the Sunne, and so eate them. Upon the
fift day, our Guide leaving us in the after-noone, well setled among foure hundred
Tents of Numidian Moores, or bastard Arabians, pitched in a pleasant Valley, betweene
two sources of Water, wee stayed still there Reposing our selves, and Refreshing our
bodies with Victuals, some nine dayes.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Moorish Smiths forging horse-shooes out of cold Iron without fire, but the heat of

which is onely molified by the vigorous heate and Raies of the Sunne, and the hard
hammering of hands upon the Anvile: So have I seene it also in Asia. I could bee more
particular here, but Time, Paper, Printing, and charges will not <span class="right-marginnote">[VIII. 379.]</span>suffer me. And now from hence, renewing our Guides from place to place, and discending
from Savage Moores to Civill Moores, we arrived (though with great difficulty and
danger) safely at Tunneis.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The Beglerbegship of Barbary.</i></span>And to conclude this Eight Part, there are three Beglerbergships in the higher and

the Beglerbeg whereof, being of great Authority, commaundeth under him twelve Sanzackes,
and thirty five thousand Tymariots. The third is, that of Algier, whose Bassa hath
under him fourteene Sanzacks, and the commaundment of forty thousand Tymariots. These
are all the Beglerbegs, the Great Turke retayneth in Affricke, except the great Vizier-Bassa
of Ægipt: although in Asia major and Minor, he commandeth in severall Provinces and
Kingdomes, thirty Bassaes or Beglerbegs.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="xd29e7791"><span class="xd29e7791init">A</span>nd now my Wish, and my arrivall, being both desirous for a while setled in Tunneis,
I dispatched my Dragoman, and the other Barbarian hireling, with a greater consideration,
then my two former conditions allowed me: Yet being urged to it by Captaine Wairds
decernitour, I freely performed his Direction. My Conduct gone, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb334" href="#pb334">334</a>]</span>I staying heere, Captayne Waird sent twice one of his servants with me to see two
sundry Ovens drawne, beeing <span class="marginnote"><i>The hatching of Chicken without their mothers.</i></span>full of young Chickens, which are not hatched by their mothers, but in the Fornace,
being thus. The Oven is first spred over with warme Camels dung, and upon it the Egges,
closing the Oven.
</p>
<p>Then behind the Oven, there is a daily conveyance of heate, venting through a passage
beneath the dung, just answerable to the naturall warmnesse of the Hens belly; upon
which moderation, within twenty dayes they come to <span class="right-marginnote">[IX. 381.]</span>naturall perfection. The Oven producing at one time, three or foure hundred living
Chickens, and where defection is, every sharer beareth a part of the losse; for the
Hatcher or Curator, is onely Recompensed according to the living numbers be delivered.
Surely this is an usuall thing, almost through all Affricke, which maketh that the
Hennes with them are so innumerable every where.
</p>
<p>And now it was my good fortune, after five Weekes attendance for Transportation, being
about the 14. of February 1616. to meete here with a Holland ship called the Marmaide
of Amsterdam, beeing come from Tituana, and bound for Venice and Malta, touched here
by the <span class="marginnote"><i>Captaine Dansers imployment.</i></span>way. In this time of their staying, came one Captayne Danser a Fleming, who had beene
a great Pyrate and Commaunder at Seas, and the onely inveterate enemy of the Moores;
beeing imployed by the French King in Ambassage, to relieve two and twenty French
Barkes that were there Captivated, done by the policy of the Bashaw, to draw Danser
hither; notwithstanding that hee was then Retired, and marryed in Marseilles.
</p>
<p>Well, he is come, and Anchored in the Roade, accompanied with two French Gentlemen:
Two of which came a shoare, and saluted the Bashaw in Dansers behalfe: they are made
welcome, and the next day the Bashaw went franckly a boord of Danser, seconded with
twelve followers: Danser tooke the presence of the Bashaw for a great favour, and
mainely feasted him with good cheare, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb335" href="#pb335">335</a>]</span>great quaffing, sounding Trumpets, and Roaring shots, and none more familiar then
the dissembling Bashaw, and over-joyed Danser, that had relieved the Barkes, for they
were all sent to him that morning, not wanting any thing.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[IX. 382.]</span>After deepe cups, the Bassaw invites him to come a shoare, the day following, and
to dine with him in the Fortresse: To the which unhappy Danser graunted, and the time
come, he landed with twelve Gentlemen, and nearing the Castle, was met with two Turkes
to receive him: where having past the draw-bridge, &amp; the gate shut behind him, his
company was denied entrance: where forthwith Danser being brought before the Bassaw,
was strictly accused of many ships, spoyles, and great riches he had taken from the
Moores, and the mercilesse murther of their lives, for he never spared any: <span class="marginnote"><i>The untimely death of Captayne Danser a Fleming born.</i></span>Whereupon he was straight beheaded, and his body throwne over the walles in a ditch;
which done, off went the whole Ordonance of the Fort, to have sunke Dansers two ships;
but they cutting their cables, with much adoe escaped, but for the other Gentlemen
a shoare, the Bassaw sent them very courteously and safely aboord of the redeemed
Barks, whence they hoised Sayles for Marseilles.
</p>
<p>Loe there was a Turkish policy more sublime and crafty, than the best Europian alive
could have performed. A little while thereafter, the afore-said Hollander being ready
to goe for Sea, I bad goodnight to Generous Waird, and his froward Runagates, where
being imbarked, with prosperous windes upon the third day, wee landed at Malta, and
there leaving my kind Flemings and their negotiation, I courted the shoare, saluting
againe my former hoste.
</p>
<p>The fift day of my staying here, I saw a Spanish Souldier and a Maltezen boy burnt
in ashes, for the publick profession of Sodomy, and long or night, there were above
a hundred Bardassoes, whoorish boyes that fled away to Sicilie in a Galleyot, for
feare of fire but never <span class="right-marginnote">[IX. 383.]</span>one Bugeron stirred, being few or none there free of it: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb336" href="#pb336">336</a>]</span>The Knights that remaine here, as they are of divers howsoever, they of the better
sort, are resolute in their atchievements.
</p>
<p>The Maltezes aunciently did adore the Goddesse Juno, whose Temple was superbiously
adorned with rich decorements, and to which for homage and devotion, came all the
Inhabitants of the circumjacent Iles; bringing rich presents and gifts; and they were
also honored with the Temple of Hercules, the ruines of which appeare to this day.
</p>
<p>Now as for their order of Knighthood, the oath which is made at their receiving, in
the order of St. John, or of the <span class="marginnote"><i>The formall oath of the Knights of Malta.</i></span>Religion of the holy Hospitall of Jerusalem, is thus: I vow, and promise to God, to
the most blessed Virgin Mary, the Mother of God, and to our glorious Patrone St. John
the Baptist, that by the grace and helpe of Heaven, I shall ever be obedient to the
superiour, that God and this Religion have appointed; and from henceforth that I shal
live chast, forsaking Marriage, and all other lusts, and to be without the proper
possession of any thing that may be mine.
</p>
<p>After this, the Chappell clarke, a Priest of the order, receiving him with divers
ceremonies, taketh a blacke Cloak in his hand, and shewing him the white crosse that
is fixed thereon; demandeth if he doth not beleeve that to be the signe of the Crosse,
whereon Jesus Christ was crucified for our sinnes, he confesseth it, kissing the Crosse:
After which, his receiver putteth the crosse of the Cloake upon the heart and left
side of the new made Knight, saying: Receive this signe in the name of the trinity,
the blessed Mother of God, the Virgin Mary, and of St. John the Baptist, for the augmentation
of the <span class="right-marginnote">[IX. 384.]</span>Catholick faith, the defence of the Christian name and service of the poore: Also
we put this crosse on thy left side, to the end, that thou mayst love it with all
thy heart, and with thy right hand for to defend it: And in fighting against the enemies
of Jesus Christ, thou shalst happen to flee, and leave this holy Signe behind thee,
thou shalst of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb337" href="#pb337">337</a>]</span>good right be depraved of this holy religious order, and of our company: This done,
he knitteth the Cordon of the Cloake about him saying; Receive the yoake of our Lord
that is sweet, and light, and thou shalst find rest for thy soule: This spoke, he
kisseth the Cordon, and so doe all the circumstanding Knights, and there are made
unto him divers Orations and precepts, contained in the Booke of their Ordinances:
They have a Priest-hood too of this same order, being Masse-Priests that weare this
badge of the white Crosse.
</p>
<p>Now bidding farewell to Malta, and to mine aforesayd Countrey Gentleman William Dowglas,
I landed the next morning at Sicly in Sicilia, being twenty leagues distant. And now
this being the third time of my traversing this Kingdome, (triple experience, deeper
knowledge) I begin to give you a perfit description thereof.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The first denominations of Sicilia.</i></span>Sicilia was first named Trinacria (whose figure is Triquetria) for that being triangular,
it butteth into the Sea with three Promontories: Capo di coro, South, Cap di passaro
West: and Cap di saro East: The length of each triangle from point to point, being
200. miles.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="la" class="lg">
<p class="line">Terra tribus scopulis, vastum procurrit in æquor,
</p>
<p class="line xd29e792">Trinacris a positu, nomen adepta loci.
</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">An Ile with corners three, out-braves the Mayne
</p>
<p class="line xd29e792">From whence the name Trinacry it doth gaine.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">It is now called Sicilia from the Siculi or Sicani who possessed it, and hath beene
famous in all former ages:
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[IX. 385.]</span>By Diodorus Siculus, it was cognominated the Paragon of Iles: By Titus Livius, the
Garden of Italy: It was also aunciently called the Grange of the Romanes, and is never
a whit decayed to this day.
</p>
<p>The length of the Iland lyeth East and West, in circuit sixe hundred, large fifty,
and in length two hundred fourty Italian miles: <span class="marginnote"><i>The fertility of Sicilia.</i></span>The soyle is incredible fruitfull, excelling in all sorts of graine, as cornes, Wheat,
Wine, Sugar, Ryce, Oyle, Salt, Allom, all kinds of fruit, wholesome Hearbs, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb338" href="#pb338">338</a>]</span>exceeding good Silke, exquisite mines of mettall, and the best Corall in the world
is found here, beside Trapundy; growing under the water greene and tender, but when
arising above, it becommeth red and hard: The like whereof is sayd to be found in
the red-Sea, and gulfe of Persia.
</p>
<p>The most of the Townes and Villages within land, are <span class="marginnote"><i>Townes set on heights reserve good ayre.</i></span>builded on the highest hills and greatest heights in the Countrie; the reason is two-fold;
first it serveth them for strength, and a great defence in time of cursarary invasions,
of which divers bee so strait in ascending, that one man may easily resist and beat
downe five hundred. The second is, because their dwellings being farre above the parching
Plaines, these situations are good preservatives for their health, whereon they have
a sweet and cooling ayre, which in such a hot climat, is the soveraigne salve to prevent
sicknesse.
</p>
<p>Their Villages be farre distant, some sixe, ten, fifteene, twenty miles one from another;
in all which grounds there is no sequestrate house, unlesse (being a high way) it
be a Fundaco or Inne. About the sides of the hills, whereon their Townes stand, grow
all their Wines, and on the Plaines nothing but red Wheat, which for goodnesse <span class="right-marginnote">[IX. 386.]</span>is unparalelled, and the best bread and abundance of it in the world is here. Sicilia
was formerly devided in <span class="marginnote"><i>The auncient divisions of Sicilia.</i></span>three Regions, to wit, the valley of Demonia, containing Ætna, Catagna, Messina, and
that angle of Cap di faro, of old Pelora: The other the valley of Neitia, containing
Syracusa, Terra nova, and the angle of Cap di Cora of old, of Lilibea; and the third
was the valley of Matzzara contayning Palermo, Trapundy, Malzara, and the angle of
Cap di passero old Pachinum: Many thinke that Sicilia was rent from Italy by the violence
of waters, at the generall Deluge, some by infinit earthquakes, and some simply conjecture
the cause to have proceeded from combustious Ætna, which is meere ridiculous.
</p>
<p>There are divers grounds and valleyes in this Ile, that abound so in Wheat, that the
Inhabitants recoyle a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb339" href="#pb339">339</a>]</span>hundred measures for one, and commonly are called the fields of a hundred measures.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Sicilians are brave Orators.</i></span>The Sycilians for the most part are bred Orators, which made the Apulians tearme them,
men of three tongues: Besides they are full of witty sentences, and pleasant in their
rancounters, yet among themselves, they are full of envy (meaning their former kindnesses
was unto strangers) suspicious and dangerous in conversation, being lightly given
to anger and offences, and ready to take revenge of any injury comitted: But indeed
I must confesse, more generously than the Italians, who murder their enemies in the
night; for they appeale other to single combat, and that manfully without fraudulent
practices.
</p>
<p>They are curious, and great lovers of novelties, and full of quicknesse and rare inventions
in all kind of Sciences, great intelligencers, and lovers of histories: As I found
<span class="right-marginnote">[IX. 387.]</span>in divers of them, who knew the passages formerly of my Countrey so exquisitly that
I was astonished at their relations, so agreeable with the trueth and times past.
The Parliament of Sicily hath a wonderfull great authority; insomuch that the Viceroy
can not have the free gift (as they call it) which is every third yeare, nor no extraordinary
thing, nor the renewing of any matter concerning the Common-wealth, without the generall
consent of the whole Kingdome: <span class="marginnote"><i>The great Counsell of Sicilia.</i></span>The generall counsell whereof is composed of three branches, called by them, the armes

Ecclesiastick: secondly of Barons called the arme Military: and the third, the Commissioners
of Cities and Townes, intitulated the arme Signioriall: The Crowne-rent of this Kingdome
amounteth to a million and a halfe of Duccats yearely: which being disbursed ever
for intertaining of Captaines, Garrisons and of Gallies, and cursary ships, the Badgelloes
and servants for the fields, the maintaining of Towers, and watches about the coasts,
the reparations of Colledges, high-wayes, Lords pensions, and other defrayings, there
rests little, or nothing at all to the King.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb340" href="#pb340">340</a>]</span>
</p>
<p>I remember in my twice being in this Kingdome, (especially the second time, wherein
I compassed the whole Iland, and thrice traversed the middle parts thereof from Sea
to Sea) I never saw any of that selfe Nation, to begge bread, or seeke almes; so great
is the beatitude of their plenty. And I dare avow it (experience taught mee) that
the porest creature in Sicily eateth as good bread, as the best Prince in Christendome
doth. The people are very humane, ingenious, eloquent and pleasant, their language
in many words is nearer the Latine, then the Italian, which they promiscuously pronounce:
somewhat <span class="right-marginnote">[IX. 388.]</span>talkative they are, and effeminate, but generally wonderfull kind to strangers. In
the moneths of July and August, all the Marine Townes every yeare, are strictly and
strongly guarded with them of the inland Villages and Bourges, both on foot and horse-backe:
who are compelled to lie there at their owne charges, so long as this season lasteth;
in which they feare the incursions of the Turkes; but the rest of the yeare, these
Sea-coast Townes are left to the vigilant custody of the Indwellers.
</p>
<p>This Countrey was ever sore oppressed with Rebells and Bandits, <span class="marginnote"><i>The Duke of Sona Viceroy of Sicilia.</i></span>untill such time that the military Duke of Sona, came to rule there as Viceroy, Anno
1611. where in the first yeare he brought in five hundred; some whereof were hanged,
some pardoned, and some committed to the Gallies: So that within two yeares of his
foure yeares government, there was not a Bandit left at randon in all Sicilia; the
like before was never seene in this Region, nor one in whom Astreas worth was more
honoured, in fortitude of mind, and execution of true Justice than this Duke, before
whose face, the silly ones did shine, and the proud stiffe-necked oppressours did
tremble.
</p>
<p>And in a word, he was no suppressour of the subjects (as many now be) to satisfie
either licentious humors, or to inrich light-headed flatterers, but serving Justice,
he made Justice serve him: for the equitie of Justice of itselfe, can offend none,
neither of any will it be offended; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb341" href="#pb341">341</a>]</span>unlesse the corrupt tongue and hand of the mercenary Judge, suffer sound judgement
to perish for temporary respects; which this noble Governour could never doe, neither
suffer any inferiour Magistrate to doe the like under him: As it well appeared by
his just proceedings <span class="right-marginnote">[IX. 389.]</span>against the Jesuites of Palermo, and his authority upon them imposed in spight of
their ambition. The circumstances whereof were very plausible, if time did not slaughter
my goodwill; and yet my patience could performe my paines with pleasure.
</p>
<p>And likewise against a Seminary Gallant, a Parochial <span class="marginnote"><i>An equitable Justice for injustice sake.</i></span>Priest of that same City, who had killed a Knights servant in a Brothell-house, the
brother of a Shoomaker, which fellow, the Viceroy caused to Pistoll the Priest in
spight of the Cardinall, and thereupon absolved him for the dead.
</p>
<p>The Cardinall having onely for the Priests fact, discharged him to say Masse for a
yeare without satisfaction for the mans life: so the Duke inhibited the Shoomaker
to make shooes for a yeare, and neverthelesse allowed him two shillings a day to mainetayne
him for that time.
</p>
<p>Many singular observations have I of his government, the which to recite would prove
prolixious, though worthy of note to the intellective man; hee was afterward Viceroy
of Naples, and now lately deceased in Spaine. It is dangerous to travell by the Marine
of the Sea-coast Creekes in the West parts, especially in the mornings, least he finde
a Moorish Frigot lodged all night, under colour of a Fisher-boat, to give him a slavish
breakfast: for so they steale labouring people off the fields, carrying them away
captives to Barbary; notwithstanding of the strong Watch towers, which are every one
in sight of another round about the whole Iland.
</p>
<p>Their arrivalls are usually in the night, and if in day time, they are soone discovered;
the Towers giving notice to the Villages, the Sea coast is quickly clad with numbers
of men on foot and horse-backe: And oftentimes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb342" href="#pb342">342</a>]</span><span class="right-marginnote">[IX. 390.]</span>they advantagiously seaze on the Moores lying in obscure clifts and bayes. All the
Christian Iles in the Mediteeranean Sea, and the Coast of Italy and Spaine, inclining
to Barbary, are thus chargeably guarded with watch Towres.
</p>
<p>The chiefe remarkeable thing in this Ile from all Antiquity is the burning Hill of
Ætna, called now Monte Bello, or Gibello, signifying a faire Mountayne, so it is,
being of height toward Catagna from the Sea side, fifteene Sicilian miles, and in
Circuite sixty. The North side toward Rindatza at the Roote beeing unpassable steepe;
yet gathering on all parts so narrow to the top, as if it had beene industriously
squared, having a large prospect in the Sea; about the lower parts whereof, grow exceeding
good Wines, Cornes, and Olives.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>My second view of Ætna.</i></span>And now in my second Travailes, and returne from Affricke, I not being satisfied with
the former sight, the kinde Bishop of Rindatza courteously sent a Guide with me on
his owne charges, to view the Mountayne more strictly. Ascending on the East and passable
part, with tedious toyle, and curious climbing, wee approached neare to the second
fire being twelve miles high; which is the greatest of the three now burning in Ætna:
whose vast mouth, or gulfe is twice twelve-score long and wide, lying in a straight
valley betweene a perpendicular height and the mayne Mountayne; whose terrible flames,
and cracking smoake is monstrous fearefull to behold.
</p>
<p>Having viewed and reviewed this, as neare as my Guide durst adventure (the ground
meane while whereon wee stood warming our feete, and is dangerous for holes, without
a perfect Guide) wee ascended three miles higher to the maine top or Cima, from which
the other two fires had their beginning. Where when come, wee found it <span class="right-marginnote">[IX. 391.]</span>no way answerable to the greatnesse of the middle fire; the other two drawing from
it the substance, wherewith it hath beene aunciently furnished; yet betweene them
two upper fires, I found aboundance of Snow (beeing in July) lying on the septentrion
sides of the Hill. It was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb343" href="#pb343">343</a>]</span>heere in this upmost Fornace, that Empedocles the Phylosopher cast himselfe in, to
bee reputed for a god.

</div>
</div>
<p class="first">As we discended on the North-east side, we came to the third and lowest fire, which
is within a short mile of the Mountaynes foote, over against Rindatza; and if it were
not for a sulphureat River, which divideth the Towne and the Hill, it would bee in
danger to be burned. <span class="marginnote"><i>The lowest and third fire of Ætna.</i></span>This last and least fire, runne downe in a combustible flood, from the middle above,
Anno 1614. June 25. Where the Sulphure streames, before it congealed, falling in a
bituminous soyle, where Wine and Olives grew there seased, and daily augmenteth more
and more; having quite spoiled the Lands of two Barons in Rindatza: But the King of
Spaine, in recompence of their miserable mishapes, did gratifie them with some of
his Crowne lands for their maintenance.
</p>
<p>I speake it credibly, I have found the Relickes of these Sulphure streames, which
have burst forth from the upmost tops of Ætna Westward, above twenty miles in the
playne. The reason of such ardent disgorgements, is thus; that when the abundance
of Sulphure, being put <span class="right-marginnote">[IX. 392.]</span>on edge with excessive Raine, and the bituminous substance still increasing; which
by the chaps, slits, and hollow chinkes of the ground (rent partly by the Sunne, and
by the forcing flames) is blowne by the Wind, as by a payre of Bellowes; the vault
or vast bosome, of which ugly Cell not being able to contayne such a compositure of
combustible matter, it impetuously vomiteth out, in <span class="marginnote"><i>The combustious devalling of Ætnaes fire.</i></span>an outragious Torrent; which precipitately devalleth, so long as the heate remayneth:
and growing cold, it congealeth in huge and blacke stones, resembling Minerall mettall,
and full of small holes, like to the composed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb344" href="#pb344">344</a>]</span>Cinders of a Smithes Forge, wherewith the Houses of nine Townes Circumjacent thereunto,
are builded.
</p>
<p>This is that place, which the Poets did report to bee the shop of Vulcan, where Cyclops
did frame the thunder-bolts for Jupiter: Whereof Virgill doeth make his Tract, called
Ætna. Under this hill the Poets faine the Gyant Enceladus to be buried, whose hote
breath fireth the Mountayne, lying on his face; and to conclude of Ætna, the grosse
Papists hold it to be their Purgatory.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Palermo.</i></span>The chiefe Cities therein are Palermo, the Seate of the Viceroy, situate in the North-west
part over agaynst Sardinia: It is a spacious City, and well Watered with delicate
Fountaynes, having goodly buildings, and large streetes, whereof Strado reale is principall,
beeing a mile long. In which I have seene in an evening march along for Recreation
above 60. Coaches; a paire of Mulets, being tyed to every Coach: The Gallies of Sicilia,
which are ten, lye here.
</p>
<p>The second is Messina, toward the East, over against Regio, in Calabria, being impregnable,
and graced with a famous haven: having three invincible Castles, the <span class="right-marginnote">[IX. 393.]</span>chiefe whereof, is Saint Salvator by the Sea side; there be divers other Bulwarkes
of the Towne wals, that serve for offensive and defensive Forts, which is the cause
(in derision of the Turkes) they never shut their Gates.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The famous City of Syracusa.</i></span>The third is Syracusa, standing on the Southeast Coast fifty miles beyond Ætna, and
halfe way twixt Messina and Malta, a renowned Citty, and sometimes the Metropolitane
Seate: It is famous for the Arathusean springs, and Archimedes that most ingenious
Mathematician: He was the first Author of the Spheere, of which instruments he made
one of that bignesse, and Arte, that one standing within, might easily perceive, the
severall motions, of every Cælestiall Orbe: And when the Romanes besiedged Siracusa,
he made such burning glasses, that set on fire all their Shippes lying in the Road:
At last he was slayne by a common Souldier in his studdy, at the sacke of the Towne,
to the great griefe of Marcellus the Roman <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb345" href="#pb345">345</a>]</span>Generall; when he was making plots, and drawing figures on the ground, how to prevent
the assaults of the Romanes.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Trapundy.</i></span>The fourth is Trapundy in the West, over agaynst Biserta in Barbary, which yeeldeth
surpassing fine Salt, that is transported to Italy, Venice, Dalmatia, and Greece;
made onely in some certayne Artificiall Salt pooles, by the vigorous beating of the
scorching Sunne, which monthly they empty and fill. The Marine here excelleth in Ruby
Corall, which setteth the halfe of the Towne at work, and when refined, is dispersed
over al Christendom.
</p>
<p>This City is in great request amongst the Papists because of the miraculous Lady heere,
reputed the Ilands Protector, and sole Governour of these narrow Seas, for Shippes,
Gallies, and Slaves: which indeede if an image <span class="right-marginnote">[IX. 394.]</span>cut out in white Marble were so powerfull, it might be credible; but besides this
Idolatrous title, they superstitiously thereunto annexe a rable of absurd lies.
</p>
<p>The fift is Catagna, placed at the Marine foot of Ætna, that was so vexed by Dionisius
the Tyrant. The sixt is Matzara South-west, over against the Barbarian Promontore
of Lystra, the rest be Rindatza, Terra nova, Emma, whence Pluto is sayd to have stolne
Proserpina, Malzara, Francavilla, Bronzo, Terramigna, and Argenti once Agrigentum,
where the Tyrant Phalaris lived, who tortured Perillus in the Brazen Bull, which he
made for the destruction of others.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The Sicilian Tyrants.</i></span>The tyrannies which were used in Sicilia were in times past so famous, that they grew
unto this Proverbe, Invidia Siculi non invenire tyranni, tormentum majus. The elder
and younger Dionisius, were such odious tyrants, and the third Dionisius worst of
all, that when the people powred out continuall execrations on the last, wishing his
death; onely one old woman prayed for his life: This reason she gave, since from the
grandfather, his father, and he, each succeeding worser and worser, and least (said
she) he dying, the divell should come in his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb346" href="#pb346">346</a>]</span>place, (for a worser never lived) I wish him to continue still.
</p>
<p>This Kingdome after it was rent from the Romanes, remained in subjection under the
French till the yeare, 1281. in which Peter of Arragon, contrived his purpose so close,
that at the sound of a Bell, to the evening vespers, all the French men in Sicilia
were cruelly massacred; since which time it hath ever belonged to the house of Arragon,
and now of Spaine, which exploit masketh under the name of Vesperi Siculi. For nobility
this Iland may compare with Naples, their styles (like unto Italy) are great, but
their revenewes wondrous small.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[IX. 395.]</span>The Sicilians have a Proverb, as having experience of both, <span class="marginnote"><i>A true comparison betweene the French and the Spaniards.</i></span>that the French are wiser than they seeme, and the Spaniards seeme wiser then they
are: And even as the Spaniard is extremely proud in the lowest ebbe of Fortune: So
is the French man exceeding impatient, cowardly desperate, and quite discouraged in
the pinch of sterne calamity. The Spaniard and the French man have an absolute opposition,
and conditionall disagreement in all fashions; and in their riding both different,
and defective: For the Spaniard rideth like a Monkey mounted on a Camell, with his
knees and heeles alike aside, sitting on the sadle, like to a halfe ballast ship,
tottering on top-tempestuous waves: And the French man, hangeth in the stirrop, at
the full reach of his great toe, with such a long-legged ostentation, pricking his
horse with neck-stropiat spurres, and beating the wind with his long waving limbes,
even as the Turkes usually do, when they are tossed at their Byrham, hanging betweene
two high trees, reciprocally waving in the ayre, from the force of two long bending
ropes.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The Sicilian customes.</i></span>The women ride here stridling in the sadle, and if double, the man sitteth behind
the woman: The women also after the death of their friends keepe a ceremonious mourning
twice a day, for a moneths space, with such yelping, howling, shouting, and clapping
of hands, as if all Sicilia were surprised by the Moores: Yet neither <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb347" href="#pb347">347</a>]</span>shedding teares, nor sorrowfull in heart, for they will both hollow and laugh at one
time: The same custome for the dead, the Turkes observe, and all the Orientall people
of Asia.
</p>
<p>This Iland finally is famous, for the worthy Schollers shee once produced: Archimedes
the great Mathematician; Empidocles, the first inventer of Rhetoricke; <span class="right-marginnote">[IX. 396.]</span>Euclide the textuary Geomettrician; Diodorus Siculus that renowned Historian, and
Æshilus the first Tragedian of fame, who being walking in the fields, and bald through
age, by chance, an Eagle taking his bald pate for a white rocke, let a shell-fish
fall on it, of that bignesse, that it beat out his braines.
</p>
<p>But to proceed in my itinerary relation, having twice imbarked at Messina for Italy,
from Asia, and Affricke, I have choosed the last time (double experience, deeper knowledge)
for the discourse of my departure thence: After a generall surveigh of this Iland
and Monte Bello <span class="marginnote"><i>Mine arrivall at Messina.</i></span>arriving at Messina, Anno 1616. August 20. I encountered with a Worshipfull English
Gentleman Mr. Stydolffe Esquier of his Majesties body, accompanied with my Countrey
man Mr. Wood now servant to James Earle of Carelill, who instantly were both come
from Malta, the generous affabilitie of which former Gentleman to mee in no small
measure was extended; meeting also afterward at Naples, as in the owne place shall
be succinctly touched.
</p>
<p>Here I found some 60. Christian Gallies, assembled to the Faire of Messina, which
holdeth every yeare the 17. of August: Wherein all sorts of Merchandize are to be
sold, especially raw Silke in abundance: 30 of which Gallies went to scoure the coasts
of Greece. Messina is foure miles distant from Rhegio in Calabria, and two miles from
the opposit Maine. This Rhegium was that Towne where Saint Paul arrived after his
ship-wracke at Malta in his voyage to Rome: It was miserably sacked by the Turkish
Gallies of Constantinople, Anno, 1609. but now by the Spaniards it is repaired with
stronger walles, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb348" href="#pb348">348</a>]</span>new fortifications, sufficiently able to gaine-stand any such like accidentall invasions.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[IX. 397.]</span>In this time of mine abode here, there happily arrived from Italy my singular good
friend Mr. Mathew Dowglas his Majesties Chirurgion extraordinary, being bound also
for the Levant in the same voyage of the Christian incursions against the Infidels,
whose presence to me after so long a sight of Hethnike strangers was exceeding comfortable,
and did there propine him with this Sonnet (which I made on Ætna) as the peculiar
badge of my innated love.

<p class="first">Here in Messina I found the (sometimes) great English <span class="marginnote"><i>The death of Sir Frances Verney.</i></span>Gallant Sr. Frances Verny lying sick in a Hospitall, whom sixe weekes before I had
met in Palermo: Who after many misfortunes in exhausting his large patrimony, abandoning
his Countrey, and turning Turk in Tunneis; he was taken at Sea by the Sicilian Gallies:
In one of which he <span class="right-marginnote">[IX. 398.]</span>was two yeares a slave, whence hee was redeemed by an English Jesuite, upon a promise
of his Conversion to the Christian faith: When set at liberty, hee turned common Souldier,

</p>
<p>After sixteene dayes attendance for passage, their fortunately accoasted heere twelve
Napolitan Gallies come from Apulia, and bound for Naples: In one of which, by favour
of Marquesse Dell Sancta Cruce the Generall, I imbarked, and so set forward through
the narrow Seas, which divide Italy and Sicilia: The strait whereof, is 24. miles
in length, in breadth 6. 4. and 2. miles. This Sea, is called the faro of Messina,
and fretum Siculum; at the West end whereof, wee met with two contrary chopping tides,
which somewhat rusling like unto broken Seas, did choake the Gallies with a strugling
force:

</div>
<p class="first"><span class="marginnote"><i>A comparison of irrepugnable streames.</i></span>Yet of no such eminent perill, or repugnable Currents, as be in the firths of Stronza
and Westra: especially Pentland firth, which divideth Katnes from Pemonia, the mayne
Land of Orknay; wherein who unskilfully looseth from eyther sides, may quickly loose
sight both of Life and Land for ever. As we entred in the Gulfe of Saint Eufemia,
we fetched up the little Ile of Strombolo: This Isolet is a round Rocke, and a mile
in Compasse, <span class="right-marginnote">[IX. 399.]</span>growing to the top like to a Pomo, or Pyramide, and not much unlike the Isolets of
Basse and Elsey, through the toppe whereof, as through a Chimney arriseth a continuall
fire, and that so terrible, and furiously casting foorth great stones and flames,
that neyther Galley nor Boate, dare Coast or boord it.
</p>
<p>South from hence, and in sight thereof, on the North Coast of Sicily lye the two Ilands,
Vulcan Major, and Minor; whereof the lesser perpetually burneth, and the greater is
long since consumed. On the fourth day we <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb350" href="#pb350">350</a>]</span>touched at Ischa, the greatest Ile belonging to Naples, and 20. miles in Circuite,
being strongly begirded with Rockey heights. The chiefe Towne is Ischa, whether Ferdinando
of Naples fled, being thrust out of his Kingdome by Charles the eight.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>A boyling Fountaine in the Ile of <span class="corr" id="xd29e8159" title="Source: Isha">Ischa</span>.</i></span>There is a Fountayne here of that incredible heate, that in short time will boyle
any fish or flesh put in it, and the taste agreeable to digestion. Departing from
thence, and coasting the mayne shoare, we had a Moorish Frigot in Chase, where seazing
on her, we found 16. Moores therein, and sixe Christians, three men, two Women, and
a Boy, whom they had taken up, in going betweene two Townes by the Sea side. The Peasants
were set at liberty, and the Moores immediately preferred to chaynes of Iron, bloody
lashes, tugging of Gally oares, and perpetuall slavery.
</p>
<p>Neere the Marine, and in sight of Naples, wee boorded close by the foote of the Hill
Vesuvio, which in time past did burne, but now extinguished: It was here that the
elder Pliny who had spent all his time in discovering the secrets of Nature; pressing
neere to behold it, was stifled with the flame, so that he dyed in the same place,
which <span class="right-marginnote">[IX. 400.]</span>is most excellently described in the Booke of his Epistles, by his Nephew the younger.
</p>
<p>Arriving at Naples, I gave joyfull thankes to God for my safe returne to Christendome,
and the day following, I went to review the auncient Monuments of Putzola or Puteoli:
Which when I had dilligently remarked in my returne halfe way to Naples, I met the
aforesayd English Gentleman and M. Woode, who needes would have me turne backe to
accompany them hither. When come, we tooke a Guide, and so proceeded in our sights;
the first <span class="marginnote"><i>The antiquities of Putzolo.</i></span>thing of any note wee saw, was the stupendious Bridge, which Caius Caligula builded
betweene Putzolo and Baia, over an arme of the Sea, two miles broad: Some huge Arches,
Pillars, and fragments whereof remayne unruined to this day: The next, was the new
made Mountayne of Sand, which hath dryed up Lago Lucrino, being by an <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb351" href="#pb351">351</a>]</span>Earth-quake transported hither; at the foote of this fabolous Hill, we saw the remnants
of Ciceroes Village.
</p>
<p>Thence we came to the Temple of Apollo, standing on the East side of Lacus Avernus,
the Walles whereof, and pendicles (the Tecture excepted) are as yet undemolished.
</p>
<p>This Lake Averno is round, and hemb&#x2019;d in about with comely heights, being as our Guide
reported infinitely deepe, and in circuite a short mile. The West end whereof, is
invironed with the Mountayne of Cuma, whether Æneas arrived when hee fled from Dido
Queene of Carthage, and sister to Pigmalion King of Tyrus.
</p>
<p>Advancing our way, along the brinke of the Lake, we <span class="marginnote"><i>Sybilaes Cave.</i></span>came to Sybillaes Cave, the entery being darke, because of the obscure passage, hewen
out and cut through the mayne Rocke, our Guide strooke fire, and so with a Flambo
<span class="right-marginnote">[IX. 401.]</span>marched before us. The first passage was exceeding high Cime, and the further end
stopped with mouldring earth. Inclining to our right hand, we passed through a very
straite and low passage, and so arrived in Sybillaes Chamber, which is a delicate
Roome, and Artificially decored with Mosaical Worke: Here it is sayd, the Divell frequented
her Company, and where shee wrot her Prophecies. From thence hee conducted us through
a most intricate and narrow way, (wherein we were forced to walke sidling in) to a
large and vast Rome: The Rockey vault whereof, was hanging full of loose and long
stones, many of which were fallen to the bottome.
</p>
<p>This great Cell or Hall, is a yard deepe of blackish Water, <span class="marginnote"><i>The old dining roome of Sybilla.</i></span>and was the dining Roome of Sybilla: In which hearing toward the further end, a scriking
noyse, as if it had beene the chirking of Frogs, the hissing of Serpents, the bussing
of Bees, or snarling of Wolves; we demanded our Guide from whence such a sound proceeded?
Who answered, they were Dragons and flying Serpents, praying us to Returne, for the
fellow was mightily affrayde: Whereat I laughing, Replyed, there was no such matter;
and M. Stydolffe desirous to know it, hee onely and I, leaving the other two behind
us, adventured the tryall: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb352" href="#pb352">352</a>]</span>Having more then halfe way entered in this Sale, stepping on huge stones because of
the Water, and I carrying the Flambo, for lacke of ayre, being so far under ground,
the light perished. Whereupon wee hollowed to our Guide, but the Reverberating Eccho
avoyded the sense of our words, neyther would he, nor durst he hazard to support us.
</p>
<p>Meanewhile it being Hell-darke, and impossible to find such a difficult way backe,
and tendering (as by duty) the <span class="right-marginnote">[IX. 402.]</span>worthy Gentleman, I stepped downe to my middle thigh in the water, wrestling so along
to keepe him on the dry stones. Where indeed I must confesse, I grew affrighted for
my legs, fearing to be interlaced with water Serpents, and Snakes, for indeed the
distracting noyse drew aye nearer and nearer us. At last, falling neare the voyce
of our guide, who never left shouting, wee returned the same way wee came in, and
so through the other passages, till wee were in open fields.
</p>
<p>Here indeed for my too much curiosity, I was condignely requited, being all bemired
and wet to the middle, yet forthwith the vigorous Sunne disburdned me quickly thereof:
From thence (to be briefe) we came to <span class="marginnote"><i>The ancient varieties of the antiquities of Putzolo.</i></span>the Bagni, the relicts of Pompeis Village, to the Fort of Baia, and the Laborinth
of Ciento Camarello, into the admirable fish ponds of Lucullus, (the coverture of
which, is supported by 48. naturall pillars of stony earth) to the detriments of Messina,
Mercato sabbato, and the Elisian fields: Thence we returned by the Sepulcher of Agricula,
the mother of cruell Nero, who slit up her belly to see the matrix wherein he was
conceived; and by the two decayed Temples of Venus, and Mercury: Crossing over in
a boat to the Towne of Putzolo, the chiefe monument we saw, was the auncient Temple
of Jupiter, who serveth now for their Domo, or Parochiall Church: The latter Idolatry
of which, is nothing inferiour to the former.
</p>
<p>Meanewhile here arrived the French Gallies, fetching home Chevalier du Vandum, the
Prior of France from Malta: Who scouring the coast of the lower Barbary, their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb353" href="#pb353">353</a>]</span>fortune was to fall upon a misfortunate English ship belonging to Captaine Pennington,
which they as a Cursaro or man of Warre confiscated. Their Anchors <span class="right-marginnote">[IX. 403.]</span>fallen, I boorded the Queenes Galley, where to my great griefe I found a Countrey-man
of speciall acquaintance, <span class="marginnote"><i>The Mr. of a Scots ship distressed by evill misfortune.</i></span>George Gib of Burrowtownenes (who was Pylot to the English) fast chained to an oare,
with shaven head and face: Who had his owne shippe twice seazed on by the Turkes,
and Mamora, which ship he lastly recovered at the Ile Sardinia, and sold her at Naples
being miserably worme-eaten. To whose undeserved miseries, in my charitable love,
I made a Christian oath, that at my arrivall in England, I should procure by the helpe
of his friends, his Majesties letters to the Duke of Guyse Admirall, for his deliverance.
But soone thereafter, being of a great spirit, his heart broke, and so died in Marseils.

<p class="first">Departing from Putzolo, we came to the Sulphatara, where the fine Brimstone is made,
which is a pretty incircling Plaine, standing upon a moderate hight; having three
vents, through two of which, the smoaking flame ariseth, and the other produceth no
fire; but after an excessive raine surgeth sixe foote high with blacke boyling water,
which continueth so long as the rayne lasteth.
</p>
<p>From thence (our Guide leaving us) we came to Grotto di cane; wherein if a Dogge be
cast he will suddenly die, and taken thence, and cast in the Lake, he will forthwith
revive: This Grotto or Cave, standeth on the side and root of a sulphure hill, the
brinke of Lago di Avagno: We desirous to make tryall of a Dog; and finding the <span class="right-marginnote">[IX. 404.]</span>fellow that purposely stayeth there somewhat extortionable, I adventured in stead
of a Dog to make tryall of my selfe; Whereupon Maister Stydolffe holding up the quartered
doore, I entered to the further end thereof, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb354" href="#pb354">354</a>]</span>bringing back a warme stone in each hand from thence: whereat the Italians swore,
I was a Divell and not a man: for behold (say they) there was a French Gentleman the
former yeare, who in a Bravado, would needes goe in: whereupon hee was presently stifled
to death, and here lyeth buried at the mouth of the Grotto to serve for a caveat,
to all rash and unadvised strangers to doe the like.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The dangerous Dogs Cave neare unto Putzolo.</i></span>The relation indeed was true, but I counting nothing of it, would needes (sore against
the Gentleman and Master Woods will) goe in againe, where entred to the bottome being
ten paces long, the moysty and choaking heat did so suffocate and benumbe my senses,
that with much adoe I returned backe; where receiving the fresh ayre, and a little
Wine, I presently forgot my former trance: which when the Dog-keeper saw, he for an
easie composition made triall of his Dog; and having tyed a string to his hinder leg,
he cast the Dog scarce halfe way in the Cave, where immediately his tongue hanging
out, he fell downe dead: And forthwith his Master repulling him backe, cast him in
the Lake, powring in water in his eares, but hee could never recover his life. Whereupon
the poore man cried out, alas I am undone, what shall I doe, the Dog that wonne my
dayly food is dead; in compassion whereof the worthy Gentleman doubled his wages.
</p>
<p>In our way and returne to Naples, we passed through Virgils Grot, being halfe a mile
long, and cut through the maine body of a Rocke, whereby the Mountaine of Cataia <span class="right-marginnote">[IX. 405.]</span>by the Sea-side is made passable; at the East end whereof neare the Cyme of the vault
is Virgils Tombe: and arrived at Naples, Mr. William Stydolffe reporting to divers
of his Countrey Gentlemen and mine, of my adventure in Grotto di Cane, they could
hardly be perswaded to beleeve it: But when avouched, they all avowed I had done that
(so did divers Neapolitans) which never man had done before me reserving life.
</p>
<p>Bidding farewell to my generous friends, I marched through Terra di lavoro, and in
the way of Saint Germane, and Mount Cassino to Rome; within ten miles of Capua, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb355" href="#pb355">355</a>]</span><span class="marginnote"><i>Great poverty under great titles.</i></span>I found the poorest Bishop (Nomen sine re) the world affoordeth: having no more (nor
never had he, nor any before him) than dui Carolini or Juletti twelve pence a day
to spend. So is there many a Marquesse, Earle, Baron, and Knight in Italy, who is
unable at one time, to keepe a foote-man at his heeles, a Dog at his foote, a Horse
betweene his legs, a good sute of clothes on his backe, and his belly well fed; so
glorious be their stiles, and so miserable their revenewes.
</p>
<p>Touching at Rome, I secretly borrowed one nights lodging there, and at the breach
of day another houres sight and conference, with my Cousing Simeon Grahame; who ere
the Sunne arose, crossing Ponto flamingo, brought me on in my journey, till a high
way Taverne like a Jayle held us both fast, where leaving our reciprocall loves behind
us, wee divided our bodies East and West.
</p>
<p>And now ere I leave Rome, I thinke it best, to let our Papists here at home, see the
shamefull lives &amp; cruell deaths, of most of their Popes beyond Seas: which their owne
best Authors in France, Italy, and Spaine, have justly &amp; condignely avouched &amp; recorded;
&amp; authorized also to light by their prime powers civil and spirituall. <span class="right-marginnote">[IX. 406.]</span><span class="corr" id="xd29e8268" title="Source: the">The</span> papists generally hold, that in their Popes, is all power; <span lang="la">Super omnes Potestates, tam Cæli quam Terræ</span>; above all powers both in Heaven and Earth: They tearme him <span lang="la">Alter Deus in terris</span>; a second God upon the Earth: <span lang="la">Deus mortalis in terris, et immortalis homo in Cælis</span>; a mortall god upon the Earth, and an Immortall man in the Heavens: Some of them
have allotted, that he is, <span lang="la">Non deus, non homo, sed utrunque</span>; neyther God nor man but both: The Popes former title was <span lang="la">Servus servorum Dei</span>; and they call him <span lang="la">Rex Regum, Dominus Dominantium</span>, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The false and arrogant titles of the Pope.</i></span>Paul the third, entering Tolentino in the vale of Ombria joyning with Tuscany, had
this salutation: Paulo tertio, Maximo, in terris Deo; to Paule the third, the best,
and greatest God on earth. Then since they will have them gods, above the God of Gods;
tell me I pray <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb356" href="#pb356">356</a>]</span>you, what a May pole Dauncer, was John 12. alias 13. of 18. yeares old, who made the
Lateran their great Church in Rome, a playne Stewes or Brothel house.
</p>
<p>What a Pope-boy of twelve yeares old, was Benedict the ninth? and after wrought by
inchantments. Another Pope they had, whom they called Unum pecus, in co quod de mane
faciebat gratiam, et de sero revocabat: A very Asse, for in the morning hee would
grant many great kindnesses, and at night revoake them all agayne. What a thiefe was
Pope Boniface the seventh? who robbed St. Peters Church? What a sodomiticall Pope
was Sixtus the fourth; who builded Stewes of both kindes, granting his Cardinals the
use of Sodomy, for three hote moneths. What an Atheisticall Pope, was Leo the tenth?
who called the Gospell a Fable. What a Hereticall Pope was Honorius the first? who
by sixe general Counsels, was <span class="right-marginnote">[IX. 407.]</span>condemned for a Monothelit: What a perjured Pope was Gregory the twelfth? and openly
forsworne: What a Negromancer was Silvester the second? who gave himselfe both soule
and body to the divell, to attaine the Popedome: What was Pope John the eleventh,
but a bastardly brat to Pope Sergius? What a sorcerer, Charmer, and Conjurer, was
Hildebrand, called Gregory the seventh? given to all beastlinesse, and diabolicall
practices; this was he that threw the Sacrament in the fire: What was <span class="marginnote"><i>A tract of beastly Popes and cruell Villaines.</i></span>Innocent the third? who was branded with this black marke, non est innocentius, imo
nocens vere, he is not innocent; but very nocent: What a wicked and cruell murtherer
was John the twelfth a Romane borne, who caused to cut off the nose of one Cardinall,
and the thumbe of another Cardinall; onely because they had wrot the whole tract of
his abhominable vices to the Emperour Otho.
</p>
<p>What an inhumane and homicidious Pope was Stephanus the seventh? who after he had
cancelled the decrees of his predecessour Formosus, caused to deterre his dead body,
cut off his fingers, and lay him in the fields to be devoured with the fowles of the
aire: What a beastly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb357" href="#pb357">357</a>]</span>Pope was Sergius the third? that after he had imprisoned Christopholus his predecessor,
he caused to draw out the corps of Pope Formosus his old compeditor from the grave,
and cut off his head, as though hee had beene alive.
</p>
<p>What a cruelty was shown upon John the 17. who after he was depraved his Papacy, had
his eyes pulled out, his nose cut off and his members, and was hanged: What a poysonable
Pope was Damasus? who poysoned his predecessour Clemens the second, to attaine the
Papality, and yet dyed within a moneth there after being Pope: What <span class="right-marginnote">[IX. 408.]</span>a mercilesse Pope was Boniface the seventh, that after he had Rob&#x2019;d Saint Peters Church
and fled to Constantinople, hearing that Pope John the 14. was replaced, he returned,
and pulling out his eyes, did cast him in prison, where he dyed of extreame hunger.
What a persecution had Gelase borne in Gaetta neare Naples, who first by the Romanes
was imprisoned, then stoned through the Citty, miserably dyed. Gregory the 8. succeeding
him, was Deposed by Caliste brother to the Duke of Burgondy, who imprisoned the other,
and starving him to Death, made him selfe Pope.
</p>
<p>What devotion fell out from the braines of Rome, to stone Pope Lucius the second to
Death: What a shamefull division was in your Papality; for fifty yeares, when Urbanus
lived Pope at Rome and his Successours; and Clemens 7. and his Successors at Avigneon.
Nay, you have had three Popes at one time; even when Sigismond King of Hungary and
Boheme was elected Emperour, to wit. <span class="marginnote"><i>Three severall Popes living at one time.</i></span>Benedict 3. at Avigneon; John 23. at Bullogna; and Gregory the twelfth at Rimini:
I pray you, could every one of them open and shut the Gates of Heaven and Hell. What
an Infidell, was Pope John 22. who denied the immortality of the Soule.
</p>
<p>What was Clement the 5. but an open Whore munger and a drunken sot. What was Boniface
the 8. he was called a Theefe, a Robber, and rooted in all unspeakable sinnes, the
eight Nero of Rome. What a furious and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb358" href="#pb358">358</a>]</span>wicked Pope, was Julius the second? who given more to Warre then to Christ, cast Saint
Peters keyes (as they call them) into Tiber. What a prophaine skoffer of Christ, was
Paule the third? who lying in bed with his owne Cousin Laura Farnesia, was sore wounded
by her Husband; he lay with his owne Daughter, and poysoned her Husband; and then
lay with his owne sister, and <span class="right-marginnote">[IX. 409.]</span>after poysoned both her and his owne mother. What was Julius the third? an open Sodomite,
and horrible blasphemer. What was Pope Eugenius? a damnable scandalizer of the Church,
and condemned by the Counsel of Basil, for an incorrigible and wilfull Hereticke.
Pope John 23. was deposed by the Counsell of Constance, for Heresie, Symony, Murther,
Enchantment, Adultery, and <span class="marginnote"><i>The Papists may looke here upon divellish Popes.</i></span>worst of all for Sodomy. What was Pope John 13. a vilde monster in his life, committing
incest with both his sisters, and fathers Concubine Stephana: Hee was a gamster, and
playing at Dice, did call for helpe to the Divel, and would drinke to the Divels health;
hee was repleate with all abhominable vices; at last being taken in the acte of Adultery,
was wounded to Death.
</p>
<p>Boniface the 8. afore named, came to bee Pope, by cousning his predecessour Celestine,
in speaking through the Wall in a Reed (as if it had beene a voyce from Heaven) admonished
him to surrender his Papacy; whose Epithit was thus: Intravit ut Vulpes, Regnavit
ut Lupus, Mortuus est ut Canis: He came in like a Fox, he ruled like a Wolfe, he dyed
like a Dogge.
</p>
<p>At the sixt Counsell of Carthage, was not the treachery and falshood of Pope Zosimus,
condignely sifted out, in corrupting for ambitious government the Counsell of Nyce.
Bernard about 500. yeares agoe, complayned much of the Tyranny of popes in his time,
calling them Defrauders, Raveners, Traytors, darknesse of the world, Pilats, Wolves,
and Divels.
</p>
<p>Albertus Magnus affirmeth, that they who now governe their Church, are for the most
part Theeves and Murtherers. And Platina, calleth some of their popes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb359" href="#pb359">359</a>]</span>vile Monsters, uncleane beasts, and strange creatures. And I remember it was noted
by a Historian: <span lang="la">Episcopos <span class="right-marginnote">[IX. 410.]</span>Romanos ne peccata quidem sine laude committere</span>: The Popes could do nothing, were it never so mischievous, but it was commendable.
</p>
<p>And even likewise are their prime Pardons, for <span lang="la">Noxas preteritas, aut futuras</span>: and their future <span lang="la">potestatem, tam quo ad commissa, quam quo ad committenda crimina absolvenda</span>; That his Holinesse hath all manner of power, as well to absolve them from crimes
to commit, as from crimes committed. And I remember about twenty yeares <span class="marginnote"><i>A false cannonized Saint.</i></span>ago Paulo Papa quinto, Cannonized Carolo Borrameo, the late Bishop of Milane for a
notable Saint, being knowne to bee a notorious and scelerate liver: done sooner by
fifteene yeares then their ordinary time, and that for the touch of forty thousand
Duckats; allotting Prayers, Miracles, Pardons, and Pilgrimages to him, and erecting
a new Order of Friers, and Monasteries unto him. And yet the poore Bishop of Lodi,
a good and charitable liver by all reports, could never, nor cannot attayne to the
dignity of a Saint, his meanes was so small when dead, and his friends so poore being
alive.
</p>
<p>And how wonderfull absurd is the Popes Bulla di Santa Cruzada, pro defunctis in Purgatory;
that for one Pater noster, at a Masse saying, or a Masse sayd for them: Sicavano fuora
dalla Purgatorio, tre anime qualche ci vogliano, viz. You shall relieve any three
soules out of Purgatory whom you please. Nay, I have seene the Popes Edict so gracious,
that induring one Masse, as many Paters as you can recite, as many soules you free
from thence.
</p>
<p>And thus me thinketh in one halfe yeare, he might soone empty that purging pit: Yet
unlesse the Suppliant touch with his finger, during his Prayers, a gaudy beede <span class="right-marginnote">[IX. 411.]</span>inraveled betweene five small fast made irons, placed before the Altar; their Bulla,
their payment for it; their Paters, their Devotion for their friends soules, are all
lost. Then say, if peradventure, the friends of the defunct be oblivious <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb360" href="#pb360">360</a>]</span>in this officiousnesse, and neglect both the Ceremony, and Pater noster, might not
the Pope justly be reputed a cruell Monster, that for want of pattering an abridged
Pater, his Cerberian Office in Hell, should detayne any poore soule in such torments,
as they say are in Purgatory.
</p>
<p>Infinite passages of the like kind could I Recite, if I had longer time and larger
leisure; and especially of their miraculous leyes, or leying Miracles; in erecting
of falshood, and maintayning of perjury; but till a fitter occasion, I will revert
to my Itinerary Discourse, and so proceede. Having left my afore-sayde friend Maister
Grahame, at a Taverne at Bilbo neere to Rome, I set forward through the vaile of Ombria
and the Countrey Romania, <span class="marginnote"><i>Ravenna the chiefe City of Romania.</i></span>whereof Ravenna is Lady, and the Pope Lord, I arrived (the way of Ferrara and Padua)
at Venice. Who then was levying an Army against the Croatian Scokes of Gradisca, and
the Duke of Grasso now Emperour. Of which Army Count Mansfield was Generall, and with
whom I crossed the Gulfe to Pola in Istria, and from thence to the siege of Gradisca:
The discourse whereof, I have here formerly avouched in the second Part of my first
Travailes. Now to speake of a Souldier, certainely hee is more then prayse-worthy
and fortunate, that hath faced the Low-Countries, reviewed Briscia in Lombardy, and
footed and sighted the Arsenal of Venice, then his eyes have first seene, the sonnes,
the force, the policies and Kingdome of Mars: Secondly, the fiery shoppe of Vulcan,
where rarest Armes and Weapons are hammer&#x2019;d out upon the Anvill, for the honour of
<span class="right-marginnote">[IX. 412.]</span>Mars; and lastly the incomparable Armory or store-house for Sea and Land, the Meggazin
and treasury of Mars.
</p>
<p>Now leaving both the Armies barking at other like to Hircanian wolves, I traced the
fertile soyles of Carindia, Carneola, <span class="marginnote"><i>Vienne in Austria no way answerable to common fame.</i></span>and Stria even to Vienna: all which were subject to the Emperour, save a part of Carneola,
that groanes under the Turke. Being arrived at Vienne, I found the Towne, and the
flying fame of it far different, either for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb361" href="#pb361">361</a>]</span>greatnesse, strength, or wealth: for the Towne rising upon a moderat height circular,
is but of small compasse without, not passing two English miles.
</p>
<p>The suburbs round about, being twice as great as the Towne; and the strength of it
is no way comparable to a hundred Cities that I have seene, neither is it for wealth
so much to be admired, being depraved of Seas, shipping, and navigation, having onely
the needfull prosperity of dry land Townes.
</p>
<p>Here I found a Turkish Ambassadour, going downe the Champion Danubio of Europe, for
Constantinople; and with him one Gratianus, a Greeke his Interpreter, to whose familiar
love I was much obliged; and with whom I imbarked downe the River to Presburge a place
where the Hungarian Crowne is kept, and from thence discending the River to Comorre,
the downemost Towne the Emperour retayneth on Danubio, I left my noble Interpreter,
and traversed the Champaine Countrey.
</p>
<p>The chiefe Townes whereof I wil briefly touch, and so proceed: Buda is the capitall
Citie of Hungary, wherein the Turkish Bassaw hath his residence, and was taken in
by Solyman the Emperour, the twenty of August 1526. the other is the aforesaid Presburge,
aunciently Bosonia; <span class="right-marginnote">[IX. 413.]</span>the rest are Belgrad or Albegrek, aunciently Taurinum, in Dutch Griechs: Weissenberge,
that was taken by Soliman, 1520. Valpa, and Singidum, upon the Danubio, both under
the Turke, and that of the seven Churches upon the River Drana taken in, in the yeare
one thousand five hundred and forty three, and Zigeth taken also in the yeare one
thousand five hundred sixty sixe.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The special Townes of Hungary.</i></span>Moreover upon the Danubio, the Towne Strigonium commonly Grana, and Alberoyall otherwise
Stulvesenburg, a place destined for the Sepultures and Coronations of the Kings of
Hungary, and was taken by the Turkes, Anno 1543.
</p>
<p>Neare the same place is Stridon, where they say St. Jerome was borne: And now above
all other the strong Towne of Gamorra, standing in an Ile of the Danuby of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb362" href="#pb362">362</a>]</span>that same name, which the Turkes have so oft besieged, yet never could surprise it.
</p>
<p>There is also Tockay, and Januarin or Rab seated too upon Danuby, a Towne as it were
impregnable, yet it was overtaken by the Turkes, and lastly recovered by the Christians.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The forces of the Bassa of Buda.</i></span>The Beglerbeg of Buda, hath under his command, eight thousand Timariots, and twelve
thousand common Souldiers which lye in Garrison, in continuall pay on the confines
of Hungary, Croatia, and Dacia, and these confines belonging to the house of Austria:
The Bassa hath under his authority 13. Sanzacks, lying at these thirteene Townes here
undernamed, to wit, Novaguard, Semendria, Simontorno, Zetshen, Ecclesiæ, Sirnium,
Capan, Zornock, Alba Regalis, Sigedin, Mucchatz, Zegedin, and Sexard.
</p>
<p>The other Beglerbegship of Hungary is at Temesara, who retaineth under his command
eight Sanzacks and as <span class="right-marginnote">[IX. 414.]</span>many jurisdictions, spreading his authoritie over sixe thousand Timariots, and eight
thousand foote souldiers; and these Sanzacks lying at Temesara, Lippa, Itishinad,
Mudania, &amp;c. The great Turke hath eight Beglerbegs or Bassawes under him in Europe;
that of Bosna being one of them, who commandeth ten Sanzacks and eight thousand Timariots;
the residence of which Bassa is at Bagivialezza, a commodious place lying in the midst
of circulating Provinces; over which he spreads the Ballucco of his power.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Hungary is a most fertile and fruitfull soyle.</i></span>The soyle of Hungary aboundeth infinitly in all things the earth can produce for the
well of man; and produceth admirable good Wines, the best whereof grow neare and about
the Towne of Sirmia, and so sweet, that they may compare with the Wines of Candy,
yea, and aboundeth in all kind of bestiall, that it is thought this Kingdome may furnish
all Europe with Beefe and Mutton.
</p>
<p>The Hungarians are descended of the Hunnes, a people of Scythia or Tartary. The auncient
Inhabitants divided their habitations in nine circles, which the Germanes named Hagyes,
and impaled them with high walles, made <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb363" href="#pb363">363</a>]</span><span class="marginnote"><i>The first plantation of Hungary.</i></span>of earth and wood, being twenty foote high, and as much in breadth, being rampierd
with divers Bulwarks and Towers of earth, whereon grew all sorts of hearbes, and fructiferous
trees.
</p>
<p>The space from side to side of each one of these circles, amounted to twenty Dutch
miles; the Townes, Villages and houses being within, and so contrived, that each one
was within cry of another: this was the first admirable plantation of the Hunnes in
this Kingdome.
</p>
<p>The Hungarians have ever beene thiftuous, treacherous and false, so that there one
brother will hardly trust another, which infidelity among themselves and distracted
deceitfull governours, was the chiefest cause of their overthrow <span class="right-marginnote">[IX. 415.]</span>and subjection under Infidels: And so have corrupt Counsellors, and insolent Princes
beene the ruine of their owne Kingdomes; for if we would have a Prince fit to governe
others, and to direct him selfe with the square rules of wisdome and judgement, to
know how to become all places, and to use all fortunes; let him bind his tender youth
with a disposition temperd with sadnesse: for such a man can neither seduce his minority
with ill examples, nor marre his waxen age with a false impression, too common a condition
of these dissolute times.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The infinite riches of Hungary.</i></span>Now as for the Hungar soyle, and Kingdome it selfe, and for the goodnes of it, it
may be tearmed the girnell of Ceres, the Garden of Bachus, the Pastorage of Pan, and
the richest beauty of Silvan: for I found the Wheat here growing higher then my head,
the Vines over <span class="corr" id="xd29e8454" title="Source: locking">looking</span> the trees, the Grasse jusling with my knees, and the high-sprung Woods, threatning
the clouds: surely if I should enter on particulars here, I have more subject to worke
upon, than any Kingdome that ever I saw: The Kingdome is divided in two parts, the
higher and the lower, the lowest, largest, and best is under the Turke, and the other
narrow proportion under the Emperour.
</p>
<p>The Hungarian miles are the longest upon earth, for every one of theirs, is sixe of
our Scots miles, nine English: so that the most that ever I could travell there <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb364" href="#pb364">364</a>]</span>in one day, was but sixe miles: Their language hath no affinity with any other kind
of speech, and yet the greatest part of the Countrey both under the Turke and Emperour
are Protestants, and are the best of all the rest, the other being Arians and Papists.
</p>
<p>There is a great Gentry in this Kingdome, but untravelled abroad, farre lesse mannerly
at home, being <span class="right-marginnote">[IX. 416.]</span>luxurious and ill taught, and damnably given to that Masculine misery, the whole Southerne
World is defiled with. Having now traversed all the Countrey to Grana, and so to Gatterad
in Valechia, I found the Country so covered with Woods, and them full of Murtherers
(for I was robbed on these confines, and hardly saved my life) I was constrayned I
say, to returne to Tockai in the higher Hungary, and from thence in one day I stepped
into Transilvania.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>A description of Transilvania.</i></span>This Countrey is so environed with high and unpassable mountaines about, that there
is but only five entries to come into it, which make it so strong and impregnable:
Within there is a rich bottome or plaine of thirty miles long, and sixe broad, being
beautified with six faire Townes; the chiefest whereof, are Cromestate, Juliastrad,
and Hermestat. The sides of the mountaynes within rise all upward halfe levell way
even to the tops, which maketh a pleasant and prospective Countrey, and the best mixt
soyle of Europe: For on the incircled plaine, there groweth nothing but Wheat, Rye,
Barley, Pease, and Beanes: And on the halfe, or lower parts of the Hills about, nothing
but Wines, and infinite Villages; and toward the extreame circulary heights, only
Pastorage for Kine, Sheepe, Goates, and Horses, and thickets of woods: So fram&#x2019;d that
every one supplieth another, for they of the Valley furnish the other two parts with
Victuall, and they againe them with Wines, Bestiall, Butter, and Cheese; each interchanging
all necessary things with one another as they need. Here I found every where kind
and familiar people; yea, and the very Vulgars speaking frequent Latine, and so commonly
doe all the Hungarians. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb365" href="#pb365">365</a>]</span>The Inhabitants here are all Protestants, but for their Vayvod or Prince Bethlem Gabor,
I saw him not, for hee <span class="right-marginnote">[IX. 417.]</span>was lying sicke of a Feaver at Juliastrad: This Province is a free Principality, and
notwithstanding adherent in some respect to the authority of the Turke. But now having
left this Religious Country, and crossing the North passage of the Hils, called the
Borean Berger, or North mountaine, I entred in Moldovia; where for my welcome in the
midst of a border-Wood, I was beset with six <span class="right-marginnote">[IX. 418.]</span>murderers, Hungarians and Moldavians: where having with many prayers saved my life,
they robbed mee of threescore Hungar Duccats of gold, and all my Turkish clothes,
leaving me stark naked; save onely they returned to me my Patents, Papers, and Seales.
</p>
<div class="figure p364width" id="p364"><img src="images/p364.png" alt="The Author beset with six murderers in Moldavia" width="656" height="720"><p class="figureHead">The Author beset with six murderers in Moldavia</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>This done, and for their better security, they caryed mee a little out of the way,
and bound my naked body fast about the middle to an Oaken tree, with wooden ropes,
and my armes backward so likewise: swearing to me, that if I cryed for helpe, or marred
them of their designes before the Sun set, they would turne backe and kill me; promising
then to set me free.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>A joyfull deliverance from a desperate thraldome.</i></span>But night come, and I forgotten, was left here in a trembling feare, for Wolves and
wild Boares till the morrow; where at last by Gods providence I was relieved in the
morning by a company of Heards: who clothing me with an old long coat of theirs, and
refreshing me with meat; one of them caryed me five leagues unto the Lord of the ground,
the Baron of Starhulds a Moldavian Protestant, with whom I stayed fifteene dayes:
And was more than repaired of all my losses, by his owne bounty, and Noble Kinsmen,
his neighbouring friends, and would not suffer mee to goe any further in the Countrey,
because of the Turkes jealousie over strangers, in regard it was but lately wrested
from a Christian Prince, with whom I was conversant at Constantinople in Sir Thomas
Glover, the Ambassadours house.
</p>
<p>Well, I yeeld to the Noble mans counsell, and giving him all dutifull thankes for
his kind regards, he sent a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb366" href="#pb366">366</a>]</span>guide with mee for two dayes journey through a part of Podolia, the upmost Countrey
of Polland, bordering with Tartary.
</p>
<p>The halfe of which Countrey I found left disinhabited <span class="right-marginnote">[IX. 419.]</span>and desolat by incursions of Tartarians. Here I determined to have entered in Tartary,
but finding no conduct nor assurance of my safety, I continued my course to Crocavia,
situat on the upper Frontiers of Polland bordering with Hungary.
</p>
<p>Tartary is thought to be sixe hundred leagues in length, confining Eastward with China,
to the South with the Caspian Sea, to the North with Russia, and to the West with
Podolia, and Moldavia.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The Tartars are mighty oppressours of Podolia in Poland.</i></span>The Tartars are not expert in Warre, neither are they so valerous as the Turkes, nor
so manly as the Polonians, who counter-blow them at rancounters; neverthelesse by
stealth of inroades, they mightily suppresse the extreamest parts of Polland. The
Turkes tearme the Cham or Emperour of Tartary, Vlakim, that is a great Prince, and
the Moscovites call him Catzar Cataiski, to wit, the Cæsar of Cataia: And hee is so
obeyed and reverenced among the Tartars, that they intitulate him the sonne of God,
the man of God, and the soule of God: yea, and the greatest Oath that they thinke
can be sworne, which they usually doe in matters of fidelitie and importance, is by
his Throne Royall.
</p>
<p>This custome of idolatrous obeysance, came first by one Rangavistah, who being chosen
to be their Emperour, would try their promptnesse and goodwill of obedience towards
him, commanding seven of his chiefest Princes, and head Governours under him of the
people, to kill their Infants, with their owne hands.
</p>
<p>And notwithstanding the Commandement seemed very rude and intollerable, yet they fearing
the common people, who esteeme their Emperours to be the divine Kinsmen <span class="right-marginnote">[IX. 420.]</span>(as it were) of God; they did cut the throats every one of them, of their owne Children,
before his owne eyes, and the sight of the people.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb367" href="#pb367">367</a>]</span>
</p>
<p>Insomuch that ever since, the life and death of the Tartars, depend upon the good-will
and word of the King, which no way they dare contradict, such is the ignorant <span class="marginnote"><i>A love not worthy thinks.</i></span>reverence they carry toward him. As for the idolatrous Rites they use at his Death,
in inclosing or interring quicke in a Vault neere to his Tombe, one of every Office
that he loved best, being alive, to goe serve him in Paradice; I will not meddle with
it, neither with the Vulgars Superstition, who Religiously feast upon the Corpes of
their aged Parents, and then doe burne their bones into ashes, giving them such a
buriall, as we give our Witches; for indeede the Wormes come short among the dead
Tartars of their foode.
</p>
<p>Being arrived in Crocko or Crocavia, the capitall City of Polland (though but of small
importance) I met with diverse Scotish Merchants, who were wonderfull glade of mine
arrival there, especially the two brothers Dicksones, men of singular note for honesty
and Wealth. It was my lucke heere, to bee acquainted with Count du Torne, the first
Noble-man of Boheme, who had newly broake out <span class="marginnote"><i>The Counte of Torne fled from Prage to Poland.</i></span>of Prison in Prage, and fled hither from Bohemia for safety. Mathias then being Emperour,
against whom hee had highly offended in boasting him in his Bed-Chamber with hard
and intollerable speeches: Saying to Mathias in his face, and before his Wife the
Empresse: Loe there is the right hand that helped to put the Imperial Crowne on thy
head, and behold now there is my foote shall strike it off againe.
</p>
<p>This Fugitive Earle stayed me with him ten dayes to discourse, and beare him Company,
for then hee had but <span class="right-marginnote">[IX. 421.]</span>onely one follower that came post with him: I found him Princely disposed in all things,
and very familiar in his cariage: <span class="marginnote"><i>This Sigismond King of Polland did marry two sisters of Ferdinando now Emperour.</i></span>At last his trayne and treasure comming with many other Bohemian Barons and Gentlemen
his friends, I humbly left him, and touching at Lubilina where the Judges of Polland
sit for halfe the yeare, I arrived at Warsow, the resident place for the King Sigismond
who had newly married the other Sister of his former Wife <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb368" href="#pb368">368</a>]</span>being both Sisters to this Ferdinando now Emperour: A match I dare say more fit for
the savage Sabuncks of Lybia, than for a Christian Prince or shepheard.
</p>
<p>But it is no matter Pope Paulus Quintus gave him licence, and in that liberty, a wide
passage to Purgatory: who, when dead that incestuous guilt will bee royally purged;
loe there his pontificall absolution.
</p>
<p>Betweene Crocavia, and Warsow Lubilina; lying halfe way it is a hundred Pollonian
miles or French leagues: Here I found abundance of gallant rich Merchants my Countrey-men,
who were all very kind to me, and so were they by the way in every place where I came,
the conclusion being ever sealed with deepe draughts, and God be with you.
</p>
<p>Polland is a large and mighty Kingdome, puissant in Horse-men, and populous of strangers;
being charged with a proud Nobility, a familiar and manly Gentry, and a ruvidous vulgarity:
They are all for the most part, of square and thicke bodies, having Bull-necks, great
thighes and legs, grim and broad faces, and commonly their shaven heads are finely
covered with overthwarting strokes of crooked shables: for they, and the Armenians
of Asia are of stature and thicknesse the biggest, and grossest people the world affoordeth.
</p>
<p>The soyle is wonderfull fruitfull of Cornes, so that this <span class="right-marginnote">[IX. 422.]</span>Countrey is become the Girnell of Westerne Europe for all sorts of graine, besides
Honey, Waxe, Flaxe, Iron, and other commodities: And for auspicuousnesse, I may rather
<span class="marginnote"><i>Polland is the Nurse of Scotlands common younglings.</i></span>tearme it to be a Mother and Nurse, for the youth and younglings of Scotland, who
are yearely sent hither in great numbers, than a proper Dame for her owne birth; in
cloathing, feeding, and inriching them with the fatnesse of her best things; besides
thirty thousand Scots families, that live incorporate in her bowells. And certainely
Polland may be tearmed in this kind, to be the mother of our Commons, and the first
commencement of all our best Merchants wealth, or at the least most part of them.
</p>
<p>And now ceasing to peramble through any moe particulars <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb369" href="#pb369">369</a>]</span>of this familiar Nation to us, I was kindly transported from Warsow upon a Waggon
to Dansick, being fifty leagues distant, with a Generous young Merchant William Bailey
my cliddisdale Countrey man, to whose courtesies I still rest thankfull.
</p>
<p>Here in Dansick I fell deadly sicke for three weekes space, insomuch that my Grave
and Tombe was prepared by my Countrey-men there.
</p>
<p>Neverthelesse in end (it pleased almighty God) I recovered my health, and then imbarked
for Alseynure in Denmarke, where being better convalessed, I recoursed backe in a
Flemish Pink to Stockhollem: where after five or sixe dayes being there, and finding
my sicknesse like to returne againe, and fearing the worst, I made hast for England.
</p>
<p>At last finding the commodity of an English shippe belonging to Ratcliffe, wee hoysed
sayle, and set forward through the sound, or Belticke Sea for Alseynure agayne: Whence
after three dayes abode, bidding farwell to that <span class="right-marginnote">[IX. 423.]</span>tributary Towne and Castle, wee Coasted the scurrile and Rockey face of Norway, at
two severall parts, but not without great stormes, and contrary Windes, yea and once
finally indangered with a threatening shipwracke, which with good lucke we happily
escaped.
</p>
<p>These tempestuous dangers past, upon the seaventh day the winds refavouring us, wee
safely arrived at London, from whence I first began this Voyage, and there ended my
second Peregination.

<p class="xd29e8634"><span class="xd29e8634init">B</span>ut now having finished the two Descriptions, of my first and second adventures; it
rests now most necessary, to relate the meritorious designe, and miserable effect
of my third Voyage. After I had (I say) by the great Providence of God, escaped infinite
dangers, by Seas suffering thrice shipwracke, by Land, in Woods and on Mountaynes
often invaded; by ravenous Beasts, crawling and venemous Wormes daily incombred; by
home-bred Robbers, and remote Savages; five times stripd to the skin; excessive fastidiousnesse,
unspeakable adversities, parching heates, scorching drouth, intollerable distresses
of hunger, imprisonments, and cold; yet all these almost incredible sufferings past,
could never abate the flame of mine austiere affection conceived; but ambitious curiosity,
exposing me to a third Voyage, I may say as Æneas did in his penetentiall mood:
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="la" class="lg">
<p class="line">O socii neque enim ignari sumus ante malorum,
</p>
<p class="line">O passi graviora, dabit Deus his quoque finem.
</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line"><span class="right-marginnote">[X. 426.]</span>O Socials! we&#x2019;re not ignorant of losses;
</p>
<p class="line">O suffrings sad, God too, will end these crosses.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">But to observe a methodicall order, I thinke it best to show the unacquainted Reader,
a reasonable satisfaction for undertaking this third, and almost invincible attempt.
</p>
<p>First, the most speciall and urgent cause, proceeded from a necessary good (the necessity
of knowledge) in the requisite perfection, of Europes full and spacious sight, the
ancient Tierce, and now most Christian world; wanting formerly no part thereof unseene,
as well under <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb372" href="#pb372">372</a>]</span>the Turke as Christian, except Ireland and the halfe of Spaine.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Certaine approved reasons.</i></span>The second cause was mooved, from a more insatiate content, that when I had, and having
compassed all Europe, my Resolution, was to borrow a larger dimmense of ground in
Affricke then formerly I had done in twice before, even to Æthiopia, Prester Jehans
Dominions. For the same effect, and a greater impression to my Resolution, I set Pen
to Paper, drawing from the distaffe of the Retractable Muses, a Poeticall Pamphelet;
Dedicated to themselves, to their profound Apollo, his then hopefull Heire, and diverse
Noble Peeres of both Kingdomes.
</p>
<p>And having from a Royall favour obtayned his Majesties Letters and Seales of safe
Conduct, and Regall recommendation, to all Kings, Princes and Dukes, &amp;c. I in all
obsequious humility, bad farewell, to this sequestrate and most auspicuous Monarchy;
and arriving at Dublin in Ireland, August the two and twenty, one thousand sixe hundred
and nineteene, I saluted the Right Honorable <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 427.]</span>Sir Oliver St Johns late Lord Grandison, and then Lord Deputy there, from whom for
regard and singular courtesies, I was greatly obliged: So was I also to many of the
English Nobility and Knight hood there: who through the whole Countrey where ever
I came intertayned mee kindly, sending Guides with mee from place to place; yea, and
sometimes safe-guards also; beside in their houses great good-cheere and welcome:
But in speciall a dutifull remembrance I owe, to the memory of that sometimes <span class="marginnote"><i>The matchlesse Lord Cichester for vertue, wisdome, &amp; valour.</i></span>judicious and Religious Lord Arthur, late Lord Cichester, Baron of Belfast, &amp;c. Who
in his time for Vertue, Wisedome, and Valour, wore the Dyademe of Love, and Garland
of true Noblenesse: Of whom, and for whose losse, if I should more praise, and longer
lament, my Inke would turne to brinish teares, and I to helpelesse sorrow: But leaving
him who lived in goodnesse here, and now in glory for ever, I celebrate these Lines,
to his eternall Fame.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb373" href="#pb373">373</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">If ever Bounty shin&#x2019;d in loyall Brest?

<p class="line xd29e792">These gifts (thy honour&#x2019;d parts) were truely thine.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">And now after a generall surveigh of the whole Kingdome, (the North-west part of Canoch
excepted) accomplished: from the 1. of September til the last of <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 428.]</span>February; I found the goodnesse of the Soyle, more then answerable to mine expectation,
the defect only remayning (not speaking of our Collonies) in the people, and from
them, in the bosome of two gracelesse sisters, Ignorance and Sluggishnesse.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The foure Provinces of Ireland.</i></span>This Kingdome is divided in foure Provinces, although some allude five, that is, Easterne
and Westerne Maith, but they are understood to be annexed to Leinster: Their names
are these, Leinster, Munster, Ulster, and Canoch: The South-most whereof, is Munster
a soile (and so is Leinster in most parts) nothing inferiour, if seasonably manured,
to the best grounds in England. The Iland lyeth almost in a Rotundo, being every way
spacious; the greatest River whereof is Shannon, whose course, amounteth to eight
score miles, inclosing within it many little Iles.
</p>
<p>And this I dare avow, there are moe Rivers, Lakes, Brookes, Strands, Quagmires, Bogs,
and Marishes, in this Countrey, then in all Christendome besides; for Travalling there
in the Winter, all my dayly solace, was sincke down comfort; whiles Boggy-plunging
deepes kissing my horse belly; whiles over-mired Saddle, Body, and all; and often
or ever set a swimming, in great danger, both I, and my Guides of our Lives: That
for cloudy and fountayne-bred <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb374" href="#pb374">374</a>]</span>perils, I was never before reducted to such a floting Laborinth. Considering that
in five moneths space, I quite spoyled sixe horses, and my selfe as tyred as the worst
of them.
</p>
<p>And now I call to memory (not without derision) though I conceale the particular place
and Prelate; it was my Fortune in the County of Dunagale, to bee joviall with a Bishop
at his Table, where after diverse Discourses, my <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 429.]</span>ghostly Father grew offended with mee, for tearming of his Wife Mistresse: which,
when understood, I both called her Madame, and Lady Bishop: Whereupon he grew more
incensed; and leaving him unsatisfied; resolve me Lector? if it be the Custome heere
or not? and if, amends shall repay over-sight, a ghostly Wife, shall be still Madam
Lady with me; if not, mine observed manner shall be Mistresse.
</p>
<p>But now to come to my punctuall Discourse of Ireland; true it is, to make a fit comparison,
the Barbarian Moore, the Moorish Spaniard, the Turke, and the Irish-man, are <span class="marginnote"><i>The ignorant and sluggish life of the common Irish.</i></span>the least industrious, and most sluggish livers under the Sunne, for the vulgar Irish
I protest, live more miserably in their brutish fashion, then the undaunted, or untamed
Arabian, the Divelish-idolatrous Turcoman, or the Moone-worshipping Caramines: showing
thereby a greater necessity they have to live, then any pleasure they have, or can
have in their living.
</p>
<p>There Fabrickes are advanced three or foure yardes high, Pavillion-like incircling,
erected in a singular Frame, of smoake-torne straw, greene long prick&#x2019;d truff, and
Raine-dropping watles. Their several Roomes of Palatiat divisions, as Chambers, Halls,
Parlors, Kitchins, Barnes, and Stables, are all inclosed in one, and that one (perhaps)
in the midst of a Mire; where, when in foule weather, scarcely can they finde a drye
part, whereupon to Repose, their cloud-baptized heads. Their shirts be woven, of the
wooll or Linnen of their owne nature, and their penurious foode semblable, to their
ruvid condition.
</p>
<p>And lastly, these onely titular Christians, are so ignorant <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb375" href="#pb375">375</a>]</span>in their superstitious profession of Popery, that neither they, nor the greatest part
of their Priests know, or <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 430.]</span>understand, what the mistery of the Masse is, which they dayly see, and the other
celebrat, nor what the name of Jesus is, either in his divine, or humane nature: Aske
him of his Religion? he replyeth, what his father, his great grand-father were, that
will he be also: And hundreds of better then the common sort, have demanded mee, if
Jerusalem, and Christs sepulcher were in Ireland, and if the Holy Land was contiguat
with Saint Patrickes purgatory.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>A foolish and superstitious errour.</i></span>They also at the sight of each new Moone, (I speake it credibly) bequeath their Cattell
to her protection, obnixiously imploring the pale Lady of the night, that shee will
leave their Bestiall in as good plight, as shee found them: And if sicke, scabbed,
or sore, they solicitat her mayden-fac&#x2019;d Majesty to restore them to their health,
in which absurdity, they far surmount the silly Sabuncks, and Garolinean Moores of
Lybia: Indeed of all things (besides their ignorance) I onely lamented their heavie
bondage under three kind of Masters; the Land-lord for his Rent, the Minister for
his Tythes, and the Romish Priest for his Fees: And remarke when their owne Irish
Rent masters have any voyage for Dublin, or peradventure superspended at home in feasting
of strangers, then must these poore ones be taxed and afflicted with the supply of
the devasted provision of their prodigall houses; otherwise in supporting their superfluous
charges for Dublin.
</p>
<p>O? what a slavish servitude doe these silly wretches indure, the most part of whom
in all their lives, have never third part food, Natures clothing, nor a secure shelter
for the Winter cold.
</p>
<p>The miserable sight whereof, and their sad sounding groanes, have often drawne a sorrowful
remorse from my humane compassion.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[X. 431.]</span>As for their Gentry such as are brought up here at London, learne to become a great
deale more civill, than these who are brought up at home, after their owne rude <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb376" href="#pb376">376</a>]</span>and accustomable manner: And this I observed, in my traversing the whole Kingdome,
I never saw one, or other, neither could move any of that selfe Nation, to pledge
or present his Majesties health; but as many other healths as you list; they will
both fasten, and receive from you, till they fall in the muddy hotch potch of their
dead Grandfathers understanding: Indeed for entertainment of strangers they are freely
disposed, and there Gentlemen of any good sort, reserve ever in their houses, Spanish
Sack, and Irish Uscova, and will be as tipsy with their wives, their Priests, and
their friends, as though they were naturaly infeft, in the eleven royall Tavernes
of Naples.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Two intollerable abuses in Ireland.</i></span>And now amongst many, there are two intollerable abuses of protections in that Kingdome:
The one of Theeves and Woodcarnes, the other of Priests and Papists: I discourse of
these corruptions now, as I found them then.
</p>
<p>The first is prejudiciall to all Christian civillnesse tranquill government, and a
great discouragment for our collonizd plantators there, belonging to both soyles of
this Iland, being dayly molested, and nightly incombered with these blood-sucking
Rebells.
</p>
<p>And notwithstanding of their barbarous crueltie, ever executed at all advantages,
with slaughter and murder upon the Scots and English dwellers there; yet they have
and find at their owne wills Symonaicall protections, for lesser or longer times;
ever as the confused disposers, have their law-sold hands, filled with the bloody
bribes of <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 432.]</span>slaughtered lives, high-way, and house-robbed people: And then thereafter their ill
got meanes being spent, like unto dogs, they returne backe to their former vomit;
so jugling with their in, and outgoings, like to the restlesse Ocean, that they cannot,
nor never did, become true <span class="marginnote"><i>The filthy corruption of Irish Priests and Wood-Carnes, theevish Rebells.</i></span>subjects to our King, nor faithfull friends to their Countrey: Unlesse by extremity
of Justice, the one still hanged before the other, the remanent by the gallowes may
examplifie amendment, contrarywise that Land shall never be quiet: for these villanous
Woodcarnes are but the Hounds of their hunting Priests, against what faction <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb377" href="#pb377">377</a>]</span>soever, their malicious malignity is intended: Partly for intertaynement, partly for
particular splenes, and lastly, for a general disturbance of the Countrey, for the
Priests greater security and stay.
</p>
<p>The other abuse is, their Libertinous Masses, the redresse whereof, I first to the
Heavens, and then to my Prince bequeath: whose Sabboth recusant mony, whereof they
bragge (as they say) in derision of our luke-warme dispensation, tendeth to none other
purpose, but to obumbrat the true light of the Gospell, and to feed their absurd,
and almost irrevocable ignorance.
</p>
<p>And neverthelesse at their dayly meetings (experience taught mee) there was never
a more repining people against our Prince and Church as they be: for in this presumption
a twofold cause arriseth, want of zeale, and Church discipline in our part, and the
officious nine penny Masse on their part: yea, all, and each of them, so exacted and
compounded with at higher or lower rates, as the officers in this nature please.
</p>
<p>The distribution whereof I nowaies paralell to the sleight concaviating veynes of
the earth, nor the sole supply of high-rising Atlas, neither to invelope the Perpendiculars
of long-reaching Caucasus: howsoever tect-demolished <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 433.]</span>Churches, unpassable Bridges, indigent Schollers, and distressed Families be supported
there-with, I am as cleare of it as they, although I smart by the contrary confusion.
</p>
<p>But leaving this and observing my Method, I remember I saw in Irelands North-parts,
two remarkable sights: <span class="marginnote"><i>A bad and uncivill Husbandry in Ireland.</i></span>The one was their manner of Tillage, Ploughes drawne by Horse-tayles, wanting garnishing,
they are only fastned, with straw, or wooden Ropes to their bare Rumps, marching all
side for side, three or foure in a Ranke, and as many men hanging by the ends of that
untoward Labour. It is as bad a Husbandry I say, as ever I found among the wildest
Savages alive; for the Caramins, who understand not the civill forme of Agriculture;
yet they delve, hollow, and turne over the ground, with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb378" href="#pb378">378</a>]</span>manuall and Wooden instruments: but they the Irish have thousands of both Kingdomes
daily labouring beside them; yet they can not learne, because they wil not learne,
to use garnishing, so obstinate they are in their barbarous consuetude, unlesse punishment
and penalties were inflicted; and yet most of them are content to pay twenty shillings
a yeare, before they wil change their Custome.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Northerne Irish women giving sucke to their Babes behind their shoulders.</i></span>The other as goodly sight I saw, was women travayling the way, or toyling at home,
carry their Infants about their neckes, and laying the dugges over their shoulders,
would give sucke to the Babes behinde their backes, without taking them in their armes:
Such kind of breasts, me thinketh were very fit, to be made money bags for East or
West-Indian Merchants, being more then halfe a yard long, and as wel wrought, as any
Tanner, in the like charge, could ever mollifie such Leather.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[X. 434.]</span>As for any other customes they have, to avoyd prolixitie I spare; onely, before my
pen flee over Seas, I would gladly shake hands with some of our Churchmen there, for
better are the wounds of a friend, than the sweet smiles of a flatterer, for love
and trueth can not dissemble.
</p>
<p>Many dissembling impudents intrude themselves in this high calling of God, who are
not truely, neither worthily thereunto called; the ground here arrising either from
a carnall or carelesse presumption, otherwise from needy greed, and lacke of bodily
maintenance.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>An Ecclesiasticke corruption in unlawfull Preachers.</i></span>Such is now the corruption of time, that I know here even Mechanick men admitted in
the place of Pastors: yea, and rude bred Souldiers whose education was at the Musket
mouth, are become there, both Lybian grave, and unlearned Church-men: Nay; besides
them professed; indeed professed Schollers: whose warbling mouthes ingorged with spoonefuls
of bruised Latine, seldome or never expressed, unlesse the force of quaffing, spew
it forth from their empty sculles: Such I say, interclude their doctrine, betweene
the thatch and the Church-wall tops; and yet <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb379" href="#pb379">379</a>]</span>their smallest stipends shall amount to one, two<span class="corr" id="xd29e8800" title="Not in source">,</span> three, or foure hundred pounds a yeare.
</p>
<p>Whereupon you may demand mee, how spend they, or how deserve they this? I answer,
their deserts are nought, and the fruite thereof as naughtily spent: for Sermons and
Prayers they never have any, neither never preached any, nor can preach.
</p>
<p>And although some could, as perhaps they seeming would, they shall have no Auditour
(as they say) but <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 435.]</span>bare walles, the plants of their Parishes, being the rootes of mere Irish. As concerning
their cariage, in spending such sacrilegious fees, the course is thus.
</p>
<p>The Alehouse is their Church, the Irish Priests their Consorts, their Auditors be
fill and fetch more, their Text Spanish Sacke, their Prayers carrousing, their singing
of Psalmes the whiffing of Tobacco, their last blessing Aqua vitæ, and all their doctrine,
sound drunkenesse.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>A flattering covenant twixt Ministers and Masse Priests.</i></span>And whensoever these parties meete, their parting is Dane-like from a Dutch Pot, and
the Minister stil purse bearer defrayeth all charges for the Priest: Arguments of
Religion, like Podolian Polonians they succumbe; their conference onely pleading mutuall
forbearance; the Minister affrayed of the Priests Wood-Carnes, and the Priests as
fearefull of the Ministers apprehending, or denoting them; contracting thereby a Gibeonized
covenant, yea, and for more submissions sake, hee will give way to the Priest to mumble
Masse in his Church, where hee in all his life made never Prayer nor Sermon.
</p>
<p>Loe there are some of the abuses of our late weake, and stragling Ecclesiasticks there,
and the soule-sunke sorrow of godlesse Epicures and Hypocrites.
</p>
<p>To all which, and much more have I beene an occular Testator, and sometimes a constrayned
consociat to their companeonry; yet not so much inforced, as desirous to know the
behaviour and conversation of such mercenary Jebusites.
</p>
<p>Great God amend it, for it is great pitty to behold it, and if it continue so still,
as when I saw them last; O <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb380" href="#pb380">380</a>]</span>farre better it were! that these ill bestowed Tythes, and <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 436.]</span>Church-wall Rents, were distributed to the poore, and needy, than to suffocate the
swine-fed bellies of such idle and prophane Parasits.
</p>
<p>And here another generall abuse, I observed that whensoever any Irish dye, the friend
of the defunct (besides other fees) paying twenty shillings to the English Curat,
shall get the corpes of the disceased to be buryed within the Church, yea often, even
under the Pulpit foote: And for lucre interred in Gods Sanctuary when dead, who when
alive would never approach, nor enter the gates of Sion; to worshipe the Lord, nor
conforme themselves to true Religion.
</p>
<p>Truely such and the like abuses, and evill examples of lewd lives, have beene the
greatest hinderance of that Lands conversion; for such like wolves have beene from
time to time, but stumbling blocks before them; regarding more their owne sensuall
and licentious ends, than the glory of God, in converting of one soule unto his Church.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Ministeriall offices strangely abused.</i></span>Now as concerning the conscionable carriage of the Hybernian Clergy, aske mee, and
there my reply: As many of them (for the most part) as are Protestant Ministers, have
their Wives, children, and servants invested Papists; and many of these Church-men
at the houre of their death (like dogges) returne backe to their former vomit: Witnesse
the late Viccar of Calin (belonging to the late and last, Richard, Earle of Desmond,)
who being on death bed, and having two hundred pounds a yeare; finding him selfe to
forsake both life and stipend, send straight for a Romish Priest, and received the
Papall Sacrament: Confessing freely in my audience, that hee had beene a Romane Catholick
all his life, dissembling <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 437.]</span>onely with his Religion, for the better maintaining of his wife and children. And
being brought to his buriall place, hee was interred in the Church, with the which
hee had played the Ruffian all his life; being openly carryed at mid-day with Jesuits,
Priests, and Friers of his owne <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb381" href="#pb381">381</a>]</span>Nation, and after a contemptible manner in derision of our profession, and Lawes of
the Kingdome.
</p>
<p>Infinite moe examples of this kind could I recite, and the like resemblances of some
being alive; but I respectively suspend (wishing a reformation of such deformation)
and so concludeth this Clergicall corruption there. Yet I would not have the Reader
to thinke that I condemne all our Clergie there, no God forbid, for I know there are
many sound and Religious Preachers of both Kingdomes among them, who make conscience
of their calling, and live as Lanthorns to uncapable ignorants, and to those stragling
Stoicks I complayne of, condemnatory Judges; for it is a grievous thing to see incapable
men, to jugle with the high mysteries of mans salvation.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>My departure from Ireland to France.</i></span>And now after the fastidious ending of a tempestuous raine-sacking toyle, I imbarked
at Yoghall in Munster, February 27. 1620. in a little French Pinke bound for St. Mallo
in Bretagne. Where, when transported, I set face to Paris, where I found the workes
of two scelerat and perverst Authors: the one of which had disdainefully wrot against
the life and raigne of Queene Elizabeth of sempiternall renowne: the other ignominiously,
upon the death of our late Queene Anne of ever blessed memory. The circumstances whereof,
I will not avouch, since Malaga detaineth the notes of their abjured names, and perfidiat
paines.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[X. 438.]</span>A just reward (may I say) refounded, upon these fond conceites, you have of the fantasticke
French: Especially these superstitious straglers <span class="corr" id="xd29e8852" title="Source: heree">heere</span>; who, when they have sucked the milke of their selfe ends, and your lavish Liberalities
without desert; returne a kicke with their heeles (like to the Colt of an Asse) in
your teeth agayne. And there your meritorious thankes, and their shamefull slaunders,
in acquittance of your vayne Expence.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The fantastick foolery of the French.</i></span>Tell me, if you be tyed like Apes to imitate their ever-changing humours? and can
you draw from them (in any Art or cariage) a greater draught, then they draw from
the Italian, for first they be Imitators; next, Mutators; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb382" href="#pb382">382</a>]</span>thirdly, Temptators; and lastly, your Plantators, in all the varieties of vanity.
Have you a desire to learne modestly to Daunce, skilfully to Fence, dexteriously to

</p>
<p>Thus, they fondly Write, thus they pratle, thus they <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 439.]</span>sing, thus they Daunce, thus they brangle, thus they dally in capritziat humours,

</p>
<p>But to conclude this Epitome of France, three things <span class="marginnote"><i>Certaine caveats for strangers, that goe to France.</i></span>I wish the way-faring man to prevent there: First, the eating of Victuals, and drinking
of Wine without price making; least (when he hath done) for the stridor of his teeth
his charges be redoubled. Next to choose his lodging (if it fall out in any way-standing
Taverne) far from palludiat Ditches, least the vehemency of chirking frogs, vexe the
wish&#x2019;d-for Repose of his fatigated body, and cast him in a vigilant perplexity.
</p>
<p>And lastly, unlesse earely hee would arise, I never wish him to lye neere the fore-streetes
of a Towne; because of the disturbant clamours of the Peasant samboies or nayle-woodden
shoes: whose noyse like an æquivox, resembleth <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb383" href="#pb383">383</a>]</span>the clashing armour of Armies; or the clangour of the Ulyssen-tumbling Horse to fatall
Troy.
</p>
<p>But now to my purpose, leaving Paris behind me, I arrived at Pau in Bearne. This Province
is a principality of it selfe, anciently annexed to the Kingdom of Navarre: lying
betweene the higher Gascony of Guyan, and the Pyrhenei Mountaynes of Baske, bordering
with the North parts of Navarre: Both of which, belongeth to the French King, except
a little of Baske toward the Columbian Alpes, and that the Spaniard commandeth.
</p>
<p>Pau is the Justice seate of Bearne, having a goodly Castle, situate on an artificiall
Rocke; and in this place was that Martial Henry du Burbone la Quatriesme borne, than
King of Navarre.
</p>
<p>Here be the finest Gardens in Christendome, the Gardens of Pretolino (5. miles from
Florence) only excepted. <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 440.]</span>Yet for faire Arbors, spacious over-siling walkes, and incorporate Trees of interchanging
growths, it surpasseth Pretolino: but the other for the variety of fructiferous Trees,
rare and admirable ponds, artificial fountaynes; Diana, and her Allabaster Nymphly-portrayed
trayne, the counter-banding force of Agvadotti, and the exquisite banqueting Roome,
contrived among sounding unseene waters, in forme of Gargantus body, it much excelleth
Pau.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Biscai in Spayne is a scurrile Countrey.</i></span>Hence, I discended the River of Orthes to Baion, and crossing the River Behobia, which
divideth France and Spaine, I entered in Biscai June 19. 1620. This is a Mountaynous
and invincible Countrey, (of which Victoria is the chiefe City) being a barren and
almost unprofitable Soyle. The speciall commodities whereof, are Sheep, Woole as soft
as silke, Goates, and excellent good Iron: Cornes they have none, or little at all,
neither wine, but what is brought from Navarre in Pelagoes or Swineskins, carried
on Mulets backes.
</p>
<p>Leaving Biscai, I entred Navarre, and came to Pampelona its Metropolitane Citty: Here
I found the poorest Viceroy (nomen sine re) with the least meanes to maintaine <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb384" href="#pb384">384</a>]</span>him, that ever the World affoorded such a stile. Navarre is but a little Kingdome,
amounting in length (with the South Pendicles of the high Pirhenese) to twenty three
leagues: That is, betweene Porto di St. Joanne in Baske, and Grono upon the River
Hebro, dividing the old Castilia and Navarre. In breadth it extendeth to seaventeene
Leagues, that is betweene Varen in Biscai, and Terrafranca in Arragon: The soyle is
indifferent fertile of Cornes and Wines. From thence I set East-ward to Syragusa,
the Capitall Seate of Arragon.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[X. 441.]</span>Arragon, hath Navarre to the West, South Valentia Kingdome, East, and South-east Catalogna;
and on the North the Alpes Pyrhenese. It is an auncient and famous Kingdome, under
whose Jurisdiction, were both the petty Kingdomes of Valentia, &amp; Barselona: And not
long ago traduced to the Castilian King by marriage. For although Castilia hath the
language, they have the lineall dissent of the Romans; the Inhabitants whereof being
instinctively endued with all humane affabilities. From thence returning through the
old Castilia, or Kingdome of Burgos, in the way to St. Iago of Compostella in Galitia:
It was my fortune, at St. Domingo to enter the Towne-Church: accompanied with two
French Puppies, mindfull to shew me a miraculous matter.
</p>
<p>Where, when come, I espied over my head opposit to the great Altar, two milke white
Hennes, enraveled in <span class="marginnote"><i>A leying miracle.</i></span>an iron Cage, on the inner side of the Porches Promontore. And demanding why they
were kept? Or what they signified? Certaine Spaniards replyed come along with us,
and you shall see the Storie, and being brought to the (Choro) it was drawne thereon
as followeth. The father and the sonne, two Burboneons of France; going in Pilgrimage
to St. James, it was their lot to lodge here in an Inne: Where supper ended, and reckoning
payed, the Host perceiving their denariat charge, he entered their Chamber, when they
were a sleepe, and in bed, conveying his owne purse in the young mans Budget.
</p>
<p>To morrow earely; the two innocent Pilgrimes, footing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb385" href="#pb385">385</a>]</span>the hard bruising way, were quickly over-hied by the Justice; where the Host making
search for his purse, found it in the sonnes bagge. Whereupon instantly, and in the
same place hee was hanged, and left hanging there, seazing on their money be a sententiall
forfeiture<span class="corr" id="xd29e8928" title="Not in source">.</span>
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[X. 442.]</span>The sorrowfull Father (notwithstanding) continued his Pilgrimage to Compostella. Where,
when come, and devotion made, our Lady of Mount Serata appeared to him saying: Thy
prayers are heard, and thy groanes have pierced my heart, arise, and returne to Saint
Domingo for thy sonne liveth. And hee accordingly returned, found it so, and the sonne-hanged
Monster, after 30. dayes absence, spoke thus from the Gallowes, Father, goe to our
Host, and shew him I live, then speedily returne. By which direction the old man entred
the Towne, and finding the Host at Table, in breaking up of two roasted Pullets, <span class="marginnote"><i>A damnable delusion of a divellish miracle.</i></span>told him, and sayd: My sonne liveth, come and see. To which the smiling Host replyed,
he is as surely alive on the Gallowes, as these two Pullets be alive in the dish.
At which protestation, the two fire-scorched fowles leapt out suddainly alive, with
heads, wings, feathers, and feet, and kekling, tooke flight thrice about the Table.
The which amazing sight, made the astonished Host to confesse his guiltines; and the
other relieved from the rope, he was hung up in his place, allotting his house for
an Hospitality to Pilgrimes for ever.
</p>
<p>There are still two Hennes reserved here, in memory of this miracle, and aye changed,
as they grow fat for the Priests chops, being freely given to the place. And I dare
swearing say, these Priests eate fatter Hennes, than Don Phillipo him selfe, they
being fed by the peoples devotion, at their enterance to the morning and evening sacrifices,
and are tearmed holy Hennes. Infinite paper could I blot, with relating the like absurdities,
and miraculous lies of the Romane Church, but leaving them till a fitter occasion,
I proceed. From thence traversing a great part of the higher Asturia, I entred in
Galitia, and found the Countrey <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 443.]</span>so barren, the people so poore, and victuals so scarce, that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb386" href="#pb386">386</a>]</span>this importunate inforcement, withdrew me from S. Jacques, to Portugale: Where I found
little better, or lesser reliefe, their soyles being absolute sterile, desartuous,
and mountainous.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The Kingdome of Portugale.</i></span>Portugale was formerly called Lusitania, and Hispania, ulteriora: It is in length
320. miles, large 68. and sometimes under: In the Moorish domination it was divided
in two Kingdomes, the one reserveth the name of all; the other was called Agarbas:
A word Arabick that signifieth the part Occidentall: And were divided with the River
Guadion, and the two Castles Odebera, and Aleotino: Agarbas was toward the South,
&amp; Portugale Northward.
</p>
<p>Portugale is now confined on the South, and South-East with Andolusia: West and South-West,
the maine Ocean. Galitia to the North: And Eastward the old and new Castilia. After
twenty dayes fastidious climbing in this Kingdome, I returned to Salamancha in Castilia
Vecchia; the Sacerdotall University of Spaine, whence springeth these Flockes of Studientes,
that over-swarme the whole land with rogueries, robberies, and begging. From thence
traversing the Alpes of Siera de Caderama, (which divide the two Castilias) I discended
the South side of the mountaines, and arrived at the Escurial; where then late King
Phillip the third, had his residence.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The palace of Escuriall.</i></span>This Pallace standeth alone, and founded upon the skirt of a perpendicular hill of
Caderama, squared out from a devalling steepnesse, having a large prospect Southwardly
towards the Evenise mountaines beyond Toledo. This palatiat cloyster is quadrangled
foure stories high, the uppermost whereof, is window-set in the blew tecture: The
stone worke below, having three rankes of larger windowes, incircling the whole quadrangles,
and French-like <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 444.]</span>high rigged. At every spacious squadrat corner, there is an high Turret erected, above
the coverture, whose tops beare each of them a golden Globe. In the middle court standeth
a round incorporate Church, arising outward in a rotundo, with a wide leaden top,
and on each <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb387" href="#pb387">387</a>]</span>side thereof a squadrat Steeple, higher then the round, making a goodly shew. It hath
neither outward walles nor gates, but the two selfe doores of the eleven incloystered
petty Courts, save onely some office houses without, and they stand alone by the hill
broken side. <span class="marginnote">Escurial is rather a Monastery <span class="corr" id="xd29e8968" title="Source: then">than</span> Palace.</span>I may rather tearme it a Monastery, then a Kingly Pallace, having a hundred and fifty
Monkes, Chartuzians, of St. Hieronimoes order living within it; the King onely remaining
in a private corner, at his comming thither. Nay at that instant, he was so private
that before I saw his face, I could not beleeve, that the Patrone of so great a Monarchy,
could be so quiet; yea, as quiet as a Countrey Baron is with us, and had lived so
nine weekes before. The house it selfe I confesse, excelleth in beauty, that Constantinopolitan
Seralia, of the great Turke: though not in divisions, and ground distances, yet for
a maine incorporate house, and was builded by King Philip the second, standing seven
leagues from Madrile, to which I arrived.
</p>
<p>Here is the residence of the Court though formerly at Valladoli: Madrid or Madrile,
is the Center or middle part of Spaine, situate in the Kingdome of Toledo, the new
Castilia. And distant from Lisbone in Portugale Westward one hundred leagues: From
Sevilia in Andoluzia ninety leagues: From Grenada Southward, sixty eight leagues:
Barselona in Catalogna, East, South-eastward one hundred leagues: From Valentia fifty
leagues: From Siragusa in Arragon Eastward fifty three leagues: From Saint Sebastian
in Biscai North-westward seventy <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 445.]</span>leagues: And from Pampelona in Navarre, North-eastward, forty nine leagues. Spaine
generally, is a masse of mountaines, a barren ill manured soyle: Neither well inhabited
nor populous: Yea, so desartuous that in the very heart of Spaine, I have gone eighteene
leagues, (two dayes journey) unseeing house or Village, except two Ventas, Tavernes.
And commonly eight leagues without any house: Villages be so farre distant, the Rockie
Seraes or Alpes so innumerable.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb388" href="#pb388">388</a>]</span>
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>It is miserable travelling in Spaine.</i></span>It is miserable travelling, lesse profitable, in these ten Provinces, or petty Kingdomes,
hard lodging and poore, great scarcity of beds and deare: And no ready drest diet,
unlesse you buy it raw; and cause dresse, or dresse it your selfe, buying first in
one place your fire, your meate from the Butcher, your bread from the Baker, your
Wine from the Taverne, your Fruites, Oyle, and Hearbes from the Botega, carying all
to the last place, your bed-lodging: Thus must the weary Stranger toile, or else fast:
And in infinite places for Gold nor money can have no victuals; but restrained to
a relenting jejunation. The high-minded Spaniard and their high topped mountaines,
have an infused contention together. The one through arrogant ambition, would invade
the whole earth to inlarge his dominions: The other by a steepe swolne hight, seeme
to threaten the Heavens to pull down Jupiter from his throne. And as I take it, the
Spaniard being of a low stature, borroweth his high-minded breast from the high topped
mountaines, for the one in quality, and the other in quantity, be extraordinarily
infounded.
</p>
<p>Certaine it is, as the Spaniard in all things standeth mainely upon his reputation
(but never to avouch it with single combat) so he vaunteth not a little of his antiquity,
<span class="right-marginnote">[X. 446.]</span>deriving his pedegree from Tubal, the Nephew of Noe. But (especially as they draw
it) how often hath the Line of Tubal, beene bastarded, degenerated, and quite expelled,
by invasions of Phænicians, oppressions of the Greekes, incursiones of the Carthaginians,
the Conquest and planting of Provinces, and Colonies of the Romanes, the general deluge
of the Gothes, Hunnes, and Vandales: and lastly, <span class="marginnote"><i>The long captivity of the Spaniards under the Mores.</i></span>by the long and intolerable Tyranny of the Moores, whose slavish yoake and bondage
in 800. yeares, hee could scarcely shake off; his owne Histories beare sufficient
testimony and Record. Then it is manifest, that this mixture of Nations, must of necessity
make a compounded Nature, such as having affinity with many, have no perfection in
any one.
</p>
<p>Their Manners are conformable to their discent, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb389" href="#pb389">389</a>]</span>their conditionall Vertues semblable to their last and longest Conquerors, of whom
they retayne the truest stampe.
</p>
<p>The most penurious Peasants in the World be heere, whose Quotidian moanes, might draw
teares from stones. Their Villages stand as wast like as the Sabunck, Garamont, or
Arabian Pavilleons, wanting Gardens, Hedges, Closses, Barnes, or Backe-sides: This
sluggish and idle husbandry, being a natural instinct of their neighbour or paternal
Moores.
</p>
<p>As for industrious Artes, Inventions, and Vertues, they are as dull thereof, as their
late Predecessours: and truely I confesse for the Spanish Nunne, she is more holy
then the Italian; the former are onely Reserved to the Friers, and Priests: The latter
being more Noble, have most affinity with Gentle-men. The Spaniard is of a spare dyet
and temperate, if at his owne cost he spend; but if given Gratis, he hath the longest
Tuskes that ever stroke at Table.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[X. 447.]</span>After a doubtfull and dangerous departure from Madrid (as Sir Walter Aston his Majesties
Ambassador can testifie with his Followers, as some of his people have already here
done the same,) being the drift of my owne Country-men, I came to Toledo twelve Leagues
distant from thence: This Citty is situate on a ragged Rocke upon the River Tagus,
being an Arch-bishops seate, the Primat and Metropolitan Sea of all Spaine: Yet a
miserably impoverished and deformed place.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Naked ambition conferred upon poore Toledo.</i></span>And although the Spaniard, of all Townes in Spaine, braggeth most of Toledo, it is
neyther (doubtlesse I know) for beauty, bounds, nor Wealth, if not for the Intrado
belongeth to it, amounting yearely (as they affirme) to 200000 Duckats; for there
is no other Episcopal Seate, in all Castilia, or Kingdome of Toledo. Giving backe
to Toledo, I crossed the crossing Siera de Morada, (which divideth the Kingdome of
Grenada, from the Mansha of the new Castilia) and arrived at Grenada, the Capital
of Andolusia.
</p>
<p>Here had the Moores their last residence in Spaine, and was magnanimously recovered,
Anno 1499. yeares, by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb390" href="#pb390">390</a>]</span>Ferdinando the Castilian King, and his wife Isabella. It standeth at the foote of
Siera de Nevada (the Snowy Alpes,) who reserve continually Snow on their tops, and
partly inclosed betweene two Snow-melting Rivers. In this Citty is the principall
Seate, and Colledge of Justice, of all South Spaine: As Valladoli is for the North
of Spaine, the high Court of Madrid having Prerogative over both.
</p>
<p>It hath a spacious and strong Castle, which was builded by the Moores, and indeede
a Kingly mansion: Where I saw the Hals and Bed-Chambers of the Moorish Kings, <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 448.]</span>most exquisitly, over-siled, and indented with Mosaicall worke; excelling farre any
moderne industry whatsoever.
</p>
<p>The Emperour Charles the fift, and King of Spaine; after his returne from that misfortunate
voyage of Algier, left a monument here, never likely to have beene accomplished, that
is, the foundation of an admirable worke advanced two stories high: without it is
quadrangled, and within round; having two degrees of incircling promontores, supported
by Marble pillars, and Allabaster arches.
</p>
<p>Being dismissed here, it was my fortune at Antecara to <span class="marginnote"><i>Mr. Woodson a London Merchant.</i></span>encounter with a Merchant, (M. Woodson a Londoner,) newly come from Venice, and bound
to Malaga. With whom desirously accompanied, the day following being Sunday, with
sore travayle wee came within night to Malaga, and thereafter parting to our severall
Lodgings, the next morning I addressed my selfe to the shoare side; where I had notice
given me, of a French ship belonging to Tolon in Provance, that was lying in the Mould,
and shortly bound for Alexandria: And finding that Transportation most convenient
for my designe (my safest course lying through Ægypt and the Red Sea, for Prester
Jehans Dominions and Court) I presently made bargaine with the Ships-master, for my
passage and Victuals.
</p>
<p>And now attending my departure thence, uppon the fift day after my comming hither
Anno 1620. October 27. the English Fleete that went agaynst the Pyrats of Algier,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb391" href="#pb391">391</a>]</span>gave Anchor at mid-night in the Roade: Whose suddaine comming, yeelded no small feare
to the affrighted Towne, mistaking them for Turkes; for the two Castle-bells Ringing
backe-ward, the thundring Drums resounding, <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 449.]</span>and the Towne all the latter night in Armes, bred such <span class="marginnote"><i>Malaga affrighted with the English Fleet.</i></span>disturbant despaire to their families, and distraction to themselves, that their wives
and children fled to the higher Castle without the Towne; and I a stayd Consort with
the Defendants till day light. But morning come, and the English Colours discovered,
Don Jaspar Ruiz de Peredas the Governour, went aboord of the English Generall Sir
Robert Maunsell; where after congratulating complements, he being returned a shoare,
dismissed the Burgers and their Armes. In that afternoone, and the day following beeing
Satturday, there came hundreds a shoare of my speciall friends, and olde familiars,
Londoners, and Courtiers, with whom desirously met, we were joviall together, till
Sunday morning: where then I went aboord of the Lyon, his Majesties ship, and saluted
the Generall, who kindly intertained mee to the next day, that the Fleete was divided
in three Squaders, and he under Sayle, and then unhappily came I a shoare in a Fisher
boate, to my deare bought destruction, beeing sore agaynst the Generals will, but
that I should have gone with him to Algier: Save onely that my Linnen, Letters, and
Sacket was lying in my hostery, and so could not go: but what shal I say?

<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb392" href="#pb392">392</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[X. 450.]</span>I was no sooner entred the Towne, and drawing up a private way to my lodging, to shunne
company and acquaintance, for that night was I to have imbarked for Alexandria, but
I was suddenly surprised in that narrow depopulated street, with nine Alguozilos,
Sergeants, who inclosing mee on both sides layd violent hands on mee, wrapping me
up in a blacke frizado cloake, and gripping my throat to stop my crying, they carryed
me on their armes to the governours house, and inclosed me in a low Parlour.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>A sad request to a mercilesse Governour.</i></span>To which when the Governour came, for I was acquainted with him before I sadly spoke,
saying, My most noble Governour, and worthy Lord, I humbly beseech your goodnes to
shew me, for what offence or cause, I am thus violently brought before you, knowing
that in me, and from my carriage, there is no injury committed. Whereat, without answer,
and shaking his head, he caused inclose mee in a little Cabinet within the Parlour,
till he went for Masse, commanding them with all possible dilligence to fetch hither,
the Captaine of the Towne Don Francesco, di Cordova, the Alcade major, and the States
Scrivan, enjoyning them to conceale my apprehending till further tryal under the paine
of death.
</p>
<p>At last he from the Masse, and they come hither, the Sergeants were dismissed, the
doores made fast, and I was brought forth before these foure Cavalliers, all placed
in chayres, and the Scrivan-table set, with pen and paper to write my confession.
Where after long silence, the Governour asked mee of my Nation, and how long, and
how often I had beene out of my Country: and whether I was bound? and how long I had
beene in Spaine.
</p>
<p>To whom I punctually returned my dividuat answers:
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[X. 451.]</span>Whereupon being inclosed in my former Cabinet, within a while Don Francesco entred
my roome, demanding mee if I had beene in Civilia, or was come from it; and clapping
my cheeks with a Judas-smile made this entreaty. My deare brother, and gallant Companion,
confesse freely that you have beene in Civilia, for your <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb393" href="#pb393">393</a>]</span>countenance bewrayeth, there are some hidden purposes in the closet of your breast;
and Para fuyr mas malo, you had best in time relate to mee the trueth.
</p>
<p>Whereat I saying no, as truth acquired, he went back, resolving them of my stiffe
denyall, and they therewith incensed, I was invited to their former presence, and
maine accusations ensuing. <span class="marginnote"><i>A tyrannical constrayned Oath.</i></span>First the Governour made me sweare and hold up my hand, that I should tell the particular
trueth of every thing hee was to demand of mee; which indeed I did according to my
knowledge.
</p>
<p>Then he inquired if the English Generall, was a Duke, or great Signior, and what could
be the reason, that he refused to come a shoare there; for that was the first impression
of their false conceived jealousie. Next; he asked mee, if I knew his name, and the
other Captaines and what their names were? and what their intention was? or if I had
knowne of their comming abroad, or preparation for it, before my departure from England.
</p>
<p>The Scrivan writing downe meanewhile every word he spoke and what I answered: well;
to all the former particulars giving condigne satisfaction, and to the last, denying
that I knew of the forth comming of the fleet, they all foure gave a shout in the
contrary. Whereupon the Governour swearing, cursed and said, thou leyest like a Villane,
thou art a spy and a traytor, and camest directly from England of purpose to Spaine;
and hath beene lying <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 452.]</span>nine moneths in Sivilia, getting sure intelligence, when the Spanish Navy was looked
for from the Indies; and that thou expressely heere, came to meete with the English
Armado, (knowing of their dyet) to give them credible knowledge thereof: And that
by thy information, they might the more readily compasse their endes, and thus thy
treachery and subtilty, hath beene imployed.
</p>
<p>Whereat I being astonished, and seriously answering for the intention of the English
Fleete, and my owne <span class="marginnote"><i>The English acquaintaynce, my greatest hinderance.</i></span>innocency concerning them: He threatning sayd, I was seene familiar a Boord and a
shoare, with the whole Captaines, and knowne to be of their speciall acquaintance:
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb394" href="#pb394">394</a>]</span>besides three hundred other Gentle-men, and Mariners with whom, and they with thee,
were so inward, that it far exceeded the kindnes of accidentall meeting.
</p>
<p>All this we saw, and hourely remarked (sayd hee) and thou art newly come from the
Generall, when thou wast taken, where consulting with their Counsell of Warre this
morning, (concerning what they assigned thee to accomplish) thou hast delivered thy
opinion, and the expectation of Sivilia, touching the returne of his Majesties Armado
di Plato; and therefore thou art a Spiono, a Traytor, and a scelerate Velacco: for
wee are not ignorant (sayd he) of the burning of St. Thome in the West Indies; for
there and then, wee had a certaine evidence of the English infidelity, and treacherous
exploytes in time of Peace: Wherefore these Lutheranes and Sonnes of the Divell, ought
not from us good Catholickes to receive no credit.
</p>
<p>Whereupon I besought him, to send for some sufficient English Factors, there sojourning,
who would testifie the <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 453.]</span>contrary in my behalfe, their Countrey, and their Fleete, but that he would not, for
my being discovered. At last seeing his damnable opinion, and to cleare my selfe of
such false imputations: I requested him to send a Sergeant to my Posado or Lodging
for my Clogbag, where hee should see a more evident Testimony of my carriage and honest
purpose, and thereupon the approbation of my Prince.
</p>
<p>This demaund liked him well, thinking thereby to finde out all the secrets and practises
of my Negotiation with the English Fleete: Whereupon forthwith, and with close Circumspection
he had it brought unto him, my hostage <span class="marginnote"><i>His Majesties Letters and Seales misregarded.</i></span>House not knowing where I was. The Clogbag I opened my selfe, and showing him his
Majesties Letters in parchment, and under his Hand and Seale, dated at Theobals 1619.
July 17. and compiled and wrot by M. Thomas Red, then Secretary for the Latine Tongue,
done in my behalfe, and my intended Resolution for Æthiopia, the Kings safe Conduct
he mis-regarded, giving it neyther Respect nor trust.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb395" href="#pb395">395</a>]</span>
</p>
<p>After which, I show&#x2019;d him divers Patents, Seales, and the great Seale of Jerusalem,
Pasports, and my Booke of Armes, called Liber amicorum, wherein, I had the hand-writs,
and Armes of sundry Kings, Dukes, Princes, Vice-Royes, Marquesses, Earles, Lords,
and Governors, &amp;c. done in Prose and Verse, in Greeke, Latine, or their maternall
tongues, being as propitious pledges of their favour, in commendation of me, and of
my Travailes.
</p>
<p>But all these would not satisfie him, nay, rather confirming a greater jealousie of
his former suspition: whereupon misconstruing all, they seased absolutely upon my
Clog-bag, viewing, and detayning all I had at their <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 454.]</span>pleasure; including me the third time. This done, and within night, beeing Represented
againe, the Governour commaunded me to subscribe my Confession, which I voluntarily
obeyed; though they still urged me further and further to confesse. Meanewhile these
foure Complices consulting about my Imprisonment, the Alcalde or chiefe Justice would
have had me along with him to the Town Jayle, but the Corrigidor refused saying, Para
non star visto con sus Pesanos: That hee may not bee seene by his Country-men, it
behoveth me to have a care of his concealement: and I warrant you (sayd he) I shal
lodge him well enough.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>An injust robbery by unjust Judges.</i></span>Upon the knowledge of this, that I was secretly to be incarcerate in the Governours
Palace, entred the M. Sergeant, and begged my mony, and Lycence to search it: and
liberty granted hee found in my pockets eleaven Philippoes or Ducatons; and then uncloathing
me before their eyes, even to my shirt, and searching my breeches, he found in my
Doublet necke, fast shut betweene two Canvesses, 137. double peeces of gold. Whereat
the Corrigidor arose and counting my gold, being 548. duccats, he sayd to the Sergeant,
cloath him againe, and inclose him there in the Cabinet till after Supper. Meanewhile
the Sergeant got the 11. duccatons of Silver; and my gold, which was to take me for
Æthiopia, the Governour seased upon; giving afterwards 200. Crownes of it to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb396" href="#pb396">396</a>]</span>supply the new layd Foundation of a Capuschine Monastery there, reserving the rest
(being 348. duccats) for his owne avaricious ends.
</p>
<p>This done, and mid-night come, the Sergeant and two Turkish slaves releasing mee from
the inferiour Roome, brought mee through certayne ascending passages, to a chamber,
in a sequestrate side of the Palace, toward the <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 455.]</span>Garden, and right above his Summer Kitchen: Where there, and then, the Sergeants,
and the two slaves, thrust <span class="marginnote"><i>And here is the embleme of my misery.</i></span>on every ancle an heavy bolt, my legs being put to the full stride, by a mayne gad
of iron far above a yard long, upon the endes of which the two bolts depended, that
were <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 456.]</span>fastned about my legs. Insomuch, that I could never sit up, nor walke, nor stand,
nor turne me; but lay continually on my backe, the irons being thrice heavier then
my body.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>A miserable &amp; helplesse Lamentation.</i></span>Whereupon beholding my inevitable misery, and such monster-made irons my sighing soule
deplored thus: Alas Sergeant, and you two Slaves, remarke in me the just Judgements
of God; and loe how the Heavens have reducted me to this meritorious reward, and truely
deserved; for I have dearely and truly bought it; that I whose legges and feete the
whole Universe could scarcely contayne, now these bolts and irons keepe them fast,
in a body length, of a stone-paved Floore. O foolish pride, O suppressing ambition!
and vaporous curiosity! woe worth the fury of your aspiring vanities; you have taken
mee over the face of the earth, and now left me in a Dungeon hole: My soule, O my
soule is leager unto this Proverbe, Man proposeth, and God disposeth: O happy had
I beene, thrice happy in a Shepheards life.
</p>

</div><p>
</p>
<p>Thus, and more lamenting the destiny of nature, they left mee with solacious words,
and straight returned againe with Victuals; being a pound of boyl&#x2019;d Mutton, a wheat
bread, and a small Pint of Wine: which was the first, the best, and the last of this
kinde, that ever I got in that woefull Mansion. The Sergeant leaving me (never seeing
him more, till a more unwelcomed sight) <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb397" href="#pb397">397</a>]</span>hee directed the Slaves, that after I had contented my discontented appetite, they
should locke the doore, and carry the keyes to Areta, a Spaniard and keeper of the
silver plate.
</p>
<p>A little while after he was gone, the other Drudge left me also, who was newly turned
Christian: where being alone with Hazier the naturall Turke, who was to attend <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 457.]</span>me, feede me, and keepe me, lying nightly a constrayned Centinell, without the doore
of my imprisonment; hee demanded me for what cause I was committed, and what malefact
I was guilty of? to whom I answered, onely for a naked suspition, mistaking the honorable
intention of the English Armado, I am as a spy apprehended, and falsely accused.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The mourning of Hazier a Turkish slave.</i></span>Whereupon the silly Slave falling downe on his knees, held up his hands, crying, Hermano,
Hermano, es muy grand menester, par a tomar pacenza, &amp;c. Brother, Brother, it is much
needfull for you to take all in patience, for it is impossible now you can escape,
some fearefull tryall, and thereupon a horrible punishment even unto death; and alasse
to relieve you, if I durst, (as I dare not under death) to discover you to your Countrey-men,
I would doe it upon my knees, and leaving me with a weeping good night, he made fast
the doore, and transported the keyes, as he was directed.
</p>
<p>The day following the Governour entered my Prison alone, intreating me to confesse
that I was a spy, and he would be my friend, and procure my pardon, neither should
I lacke (interim) any needfull thing: But I still attesting my innocency, hee wrathfully
swore I should see his face no more, till grievous torments should make me doe it;
and leaving mee in a rage, he observed too well his condition.
</p>
<p>But withall in my audience, he commanded Areta, that none should come neare mee except
the slave, nor no food should be given mee but three ounces of moosted browne bread,
every second day, and a Fuleto or English Pint of water, neither any bed, pillow,
or coverlet to be allowed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb398" href="#pb398">398</a>]</span>mee: And close up sayd he, this window in his roome, with lyme and stone, stop the
holes of the doore with double <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 458.]</span>Matts, hanging another locking to it; and to withdraw all visible and sensible comfort
from him, let no tongue, nor feet be heard neare him, till I have my designes accomplished:
And thou Hazier I charge thee, at thy incommings to have no conference with him, nor
at thy out-goings abroad to discover him to the English Factors, as thou wilt answer
upon thy life, and the highest torments can be devised.
</p>
<p>These directions delivered, and alas too accessary to me in the performance: my roome
was made a darke-drawne Dungeon, my belly the anatomy of mercilesse hunger, my comfortlesse
hearing, the receptacle of sounding Bells, my eye wanting light, a loathsome languishing
in despaire, and my ground lying body, the woefull mirrour of misfortunes: every houre
wishing anothers comming, every day the night, and every night the morning.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>A speedy expedition for a mercilesse mischeife.</i></span>And now being every second or third day attended with the twinckling of an eye, and
my sustenance agreeable to my attendance, my body grew exceeding debile and infirme;
insomuch that the Governour (after his answers receaved from Madrile) made haste to
put in execution, his bloody and mercilesse purpose before Christmas Holy-dayes: least
ere the expiring of the twelfth day, I should be utterly famished, and unable to undergoe
my tryall, without present perishing, yet unknowne to me, save onely in this knowledge,
that I was confident to dye a fearefull and unacquainted death: for it is a current
custome with the Spaniard, that if a stranger be apprehended upon any suspicion, he
is never brought to open tryall, and common Jayle, but clapd up in a Dungeon, and
there tortured, impoysoned, or starved to death: Such meritorious deeds, accompany
these onely titular Christians: for the Spaniard <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 459.]</span>accounteth it more to be called a Christian, than either to beleeve what hee professeth,
or to conforme him selfe to the life of Christianity: yea, I sparingly avouch it,
hee is the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb399" href="#pb399">399</a>]</span>worst and baddest creature of the Christian name; having no more Religion (and lesse
respective to devotion) than an externall presumptuous show; which perfiteth this
ancient Proverbe, The Spaniard; est bonus Catholicus, sed malus Christianus.
</p>
<p>In end, by Gods permission, the scourge of my fiery tryall approaching; upon the forty
seventh day after my first imprisonment, and five dayes before Christmas; about two
a clocke in the morning, I heard the noyse of a Coach in the fore-street, marvelling
much what it might meane.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>My transportation from prison to the fields to be racked.</i></span>Within a pretty while I heard the locks of my Prison-doore in opening; whereupon bequeathing
my soule to God, I humbly implored his gracious mercie and pardon for my sinnes: for
neither in the former night nor this, could I get any sleepe, such was the force of
gnawing hunger, and the portending heavinesse of my presaging soule.
</p>
<p>Meanewhile the former nine Sergeants, accompanied with the Scrivan, entered the roome
without word speaking, and carrying mee thence, with irons and all, on their armes
through the house, to the street, they layd mee on my backe in the Coach: where two
of them sat up beside mee, (the rest using great silence) went softly along by the
Coach side.
</p>
<p>Then Baptista the Coach-man, an Indian Negro droving out at the Sea-gate, the way
of the shoare-side, I was brought Westward almost a league from the Towne, to a Vine-presse
house, standing alone amongst Vineyards, <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 460.]</span>where they inclosed mee in a roome till day light, for hither was the Racke brought
the night before, and privately placed in the ende of a Trance.
</p>
<p>And all this secresie was used, that neyther English, French, or Flemings, should
see or get any knowledge of my Tryall, my grievous Tortures, and dreadfull dispatch,
because of their treacherous and cruel proceedings.
</p>
<p>At the breach of day the Governour, Don Francesco, and the Alcalde, came foorth in
another Coach: where when arrived, and I invited to their presence, I pleaded <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb400" href="#pb400">400</a>]</span><span class="marginnote"><i>A stranger ought not to be accused with strangers without an Interpreter.</i></span>for a Trench man, being against their Law, to accuse or condemne a Stranger, without
a sufficient Interpreter. The which they absolutely refused, neyther would they suffer
or grant mee an Appellation to Madrid.
</p>
<p>And now after long and new Examinations, from morning to darke night, they finding
my first and second Confession so runne in one, that the Governour swore, I had learned
the Arte of Memory: Saying further, is it possible hee can in such distresse, and
so long a time, observe so strictly in every manner the poynts of his first Confession,
and I so often shifting him too and fro.
</p>
<p>Well, the Governours interrogation and my Confession being mutually subscribed: He
and Don Francesco besought me earnestly to acknowledge and confesse my guiltinesse
in time: if not, he would deliver me in the Alcaldes hands there present: Saying moreover,
thou art as yet in my power, and I may spare or pardon thee; providing thou wilt confesse
thy selfe a Spie, and a Traytour against our Nation.
</p>
<p>But finding mee stand fast to the marke of my spotlesse innocency, he, invective,
and malicious hee, after many <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 461.]</span>tremenduous threatnings, commanded the Scrivan to draw up a Warrant for the chiefe
Justice: And done, he set his hand to it, and taking me by the hand, delivered me
and the Warrant in the Alcalde Majors hands, to cause mee bee Tortured, broken, and
cruelly Tormented.
</p>
<p>Whence being carried along on the Sergeants armes, to the end of a Trance or stone
Gallery, where the Pottaro or Racke was placed: The Encarnador or Tormentor, begunne
to disburden me of my irons, which beeing very hard inbolted he could not Ram-verse
the Wedges for a long time: Whereat the Chiefe Justice being offended, the malicious
Villaine with the Hammer which he had in his hand, stroake away above an inch of my
left heele with <span class="marginnote"><i>A mercilesse hurt, before they begun to Racke mee.</i></span>the Bolt. Whereupon I grievously groaning, beeing exceeding faint, and without my
three ounces of bread, and a little Water for three dayes together: The Alcalde <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb401" href="#pb401">401</a>]</span>sayd, O Traytor all this is nothing, but the earnest of a greater bargaine you have
in hand.
</p>
<p>Now the irons being dissolved, and my Torments approaching, I fell prostrate on my
knees, crying to the Heavens:
</p>
<p>O Great and Gracious GOD, it is truely knowne to thy all-seeing Eye, that I am innocent
of these false and fearefull accusations, and since therefore it is thy Good will
and pleasure, that I must suffer now by the scelerate hands of mercilesse men: Lord
furnish mee, with Courage, Strength, and Patience least by an impatient Minde, and
feebling Spirit, I become my owne Murtherer, in Confessing my selfe guilty of Death,
to shunne present punishment. And according to the Multitude of thy Mercies, O Lord,
bee mercifull to my sinfull soule, and that for Jesus thy Sonne and my Redeemer his
sake.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[x. 462.]</span>After this, the Alcalde, and Scrivan, being both chaire-set, the one to examine, the
other to write downe my Confession and Tortures: I was by the Executioner stripped
to the skin, brought to the Racke, and then mounted by him on the top of it: Where
eftsoones I was hung by the bare shoulders, with two small Cords, which went under
both mine armes, running on two Rings of iron that were fixed in the Wall above my
head.
</p>
<p>Thus being hoysed, to the appoynted height, the Tormentor discended below, and drawing
downe my Legs, through the two sides of the three-planked Racke, hee tyed a Cord about
each of my ancles: And then ascending upon the Racke, hee drew the Cords upward, and
bending <span class="marginnote"><i>The hammes and lids of my knees were both broken.</i></span>forward with maine force, my two knees, against the two plankes; the sinewes of my
hammes burst a sunder, and the lids of my knees beeing crushed, and the Cords made
fast, I hung so demayned, for a large houre.
</p>
<p>At last the Encarnador, informing the Governor, that I had the marke of Jerusalem
on my right arme, joyned with the name and Crowne of King James, and done upon the
Holy Grave. The Corrigidor came out of his adjoyning stance, and gave direction, to
teare a sunder, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb402" href="#pb402">402</a>]</span>the name, and Crowne (as hee sayd) of that Hereticke King, and arch-enemy to the Holy
Catholicke Church: Then the Tormentor, laying the right arme above the left, and the
Crowne upmost, did cast a Cord over both armes, seaven distant times: And then lying
downe upon his backe, and setting both his feete on my hollow-pinched belly, he charged;
and drew violently with his hands, making my Wombe support the force of his feete,
till the seaven severall Cords combind in one place of my arme, (and cutting the Crowne,
sinewes, and flesh to the bare <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 453.]</span>bones) did pull in my fingers close to the palme of my hands: the left hand of which
is Lame so still, and will be for ever.
</p>
<p>Now mine eyes begun to startle, my mouth to foame and froath, and my teeth to chatter
like to the doubling of <span class="marginnote"><i>O cruell and inhumane murder.</i></span>Drummers stickes. O strange inhumanity of Men-monster Manglers! surpassing the limits
of their nationall Law; three score Tortures beeing the tryall of Treason, which I
had, and was to indure: yet thus to inflict a seaven-fold surplussage of more intolerable
cruelties: And notwithstanding of my shivering lippes, in this fiery passion, my vehement
groaning, and blood-springing fonts, from armes, broake sinewes, hammes, and knees;
yea, and my depending weight on flesh-cutting Cords; yet they stroke mee on the face
with Cudgels, to abate and cease the thundring noyse of my wrestling voyce.
</p>
<p>At last being loosed from these Pinnacles of paine, I was hand-fast set on the floore,
with this their incessant imploration: Confesse, confesse, confesse in time, for thine
inevitable torments ensue: where finding nothing from me, but still innocent, O I
am innocent, O Jesus! the Lambe of God have mercy upon mee, and strengthen mee with
patience, to undergoe this barbarous murder.

</div><p>
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Here begun my mayne tortures.</i></span>Then by command of the Justice, was my trembling body layd above, and along upon the
face of the Racke, with my head downe-ward, inclosed within a circled hole, my belly
upmost, and my heeles upward toward the top of the Racke: my legs and armes being
drawne a sunder, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb403" href="#pb403">403</a>]</span>were fastned with pinnes and Cords, to both sides of the outward plankes; for now
was I to receive my maine torments.
</p>
<p>Now what a Pottaro or Racke is (for it stood by the <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 464.]</span>wall declining downe-ward) it is made of three plankes of Timber, the upmost end whereof
is larger then a ful <span class="marginnote"><i>Loe here is the manner how I was mainly Racked.</i></span>stride; the lower end being narrow, and the three planks joyning together, are made
conformable to a Mans shoulders: in the downe-most end of the middle planke there
was a hole, wherein my head was layd: in length it <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 465.]</span>is longer than a man, being interlaced with small cords from planke to planke, which
divided my supported thighes from the middle plank: Through the sides of which exteriour
planks there were three distant holes in every one of them; the use wherefore you
shall presently heare.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The manner how my body was first fastned to the Racke before my tortures were inflicted.</i></span>Now the Alcalde giving commission, the executioner layd first a cord over the calfe
of my leg, then another on the middle of my thigh, and the third cord over the great
of my arme; which was severally done, on both sides of my body receaving the ends
of the cords, from these sixe severall places through the holes made in the outward
planks, which were fastned to pinnes, and the pinnes made fast with a device: for
he was to charge on the out side of the planks, with as many pinnes, as there were
holes and cords; the cords being first laid meet to my skin: And on every one of these
sixe parts of my body, I was to receave seven severall tortures: each torture consisting
of three winding throwes, of every pinne; which amounted to twenty one throwes, in
every one of these sixe parts.
</p>
<p>Then the Tormentor having charged the first passage about my body (making fast by
a device each torture as they were multiplied) he went to an earthen Jarre standing
full of water, a little beneath my head: from whence carrying a pot full of water;
in the bottome whereof, there was an incised hole, which being stopd by his thumb,
till it came to my mouth, hee did powre it in my bellie; the measure being a Spanish
Sombre, which is an English <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb404" href="#pb404">404</a>]</span>Potle: The first and second services I gladly receaved, such was the scorching drouth
of my tormenting payne, and likewise I had drunke none for three dayes before.
</p>
<p>But afterward, at the third charge, perceiving these <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 466.]</span>measures of water to be inflicted upon me as tortures, O strangling tortures! I closed
my lips, gaine-standing that eager crudelity.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>A cruelty beyond cruelties.</i></span>Whereat the Alcalde inraging, set my teeth asunder with a payre of iron cadges, detayning
them there, at every severall turne, both mainely and manually; whereupon my hunger-clungd
bellie waxing great, grew Drum-like imbolstered: for it being a suffocating payne,
in regard of my head hanging downeward, and the water reingorging it selfe in my throat
with a strugling force; it strangled and swallowed up my breath from youling and groaning.
</p>
<p>And now to prevent my renewing griefe (for presently my heart fayleth and forsaketh
me) I will onely briefly avouch, that betweene each one of these seven circular charges,
I was aye reexamined, each examination continuing halfe an houre; each halfe houre
a hell of infernall paine, and betweene each torment, a long distance of life quelling
time.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>A hellish and insupportable payne.</i></span>Thus lay I sixe houres upon the Racke, betweene foure a clocke afternoone, and ten
a clocke at night, having had inflicted upon me three score seven torments: Neverthelesse
they continued me a large halfe houre (after all my tortures) at the full bending;
where my body being all begored with blood, and cut through in every part, to the
crushed and bruised bones, I pittifully remayned, stil roaring, howling, foaming,
bellowing, and gnashing my teeth, with insupportable cryes, before the pinnes were
undone, and my body loosed.
</p>
<p>True it is, it passeth the capacity of man, either sensibly to conceave, or I patiently
to expresse the intollerable anxiety of mind, and affliction of body in that dreadfull
time I sustayned.
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[X. 467.]</span>At last my head being by their armes advanced, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb405" href="#pb405">405</a>]</span>my body taken from the Rack, the water regushed abundantly from my mouth; then they
recloathing my broken, bloody, and cold trembling body, being all this time starke
naked, I fell twice in a sounding trance: which they againe refreshed with a little
Wine, and two warme Egges, not for charity done, but that I should be reserved to
further punishment; and if it were not too truely knowne these sufferings to be of
trueth, it would almost seeme incredible to many, that a man being brought so low,
with starving hunger, and extreame cruelties, could have subsisted any longer reserving
life.
</p>
<p>And now at last they charged my broken legs, with my former eye-frighting irons, and
done, I was lamentably carryed on their armes to the Coach, being after mid-night,
and secretly transported to my former Dungeon without any knowledge of the Towne,
save onely these my <span class="marginnote"><i>A lamentable remembrance of inhumane cruelty.</i></span>lawlesse, and mercilesse Tormentors: where, when come, I was layd with my head and
my heeles alike high, on my former stones.
</p>
<p>The latter end of this woefull night poore mourning Hazier the Turke, was set to keepe
me, and on the morrow, the Governour entred my roome threatning me still with moe
tortures to confesse, and so caused he every morning long before day, his Coach to
be rumbled at his gate, and about me where I lay, a great noyse of tongues, <span class="marginnote"><i>A dreadfull affrighting for more tortures.</i></span>and opening of doores: and all this they did of purpose to affright and distract me,
and to make me beleeve I was going to be rackt againe, to make me confesse an untrueth;
still thus they continued every day of five dayes till Christmas.
</p>
<p>Upon Christmas day Mariana the Ladies Gentlewoman got permission to visit me, and
with her licence, she <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 468.]</span>brought abundance of teares presenting me also with a dish of Honey and Sugar, some
confections, and Rasins in a great plenty to my no small comfort, besides using many
sweet speeches for consolations sake.
</p>
<p>Shee gone, and the next morning of Saint Johns day come, long ere day the Towne was
in Armes, the Bells <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb406" href="#pb406">406</a>]</span>ringing backward, the people shouting, and Drummes beating; whereat my soule was over-joyed,
thinking that the Moores had seazed upon all: And in the after noone the Turke comming
to me with bread and water, being by chance the second day, I asked him what the fray
was? <span class="marginnote"><i>Alas too good newes not to have been true.</i></span>who replyed, be of good courage, I hope in God and Mahomet, that you and I ere long
shall be set at liberty; for your Countrey-men, the English Armado, and mine the Moores,
are joyned together, and comming to sacke Malaga: And this morning Post came from
Allagant to premonish the Governour thereof; whereupon he and the Towne have instantly
pulled downe, all the Cowper shops, and dwelling houses that were builded without
by the shoare side, adjoyning to the Townes Wall: But yet sayd he it is no matter,
the Towne may easily be surprised, and I hope we shall be merry in Algier, for there
is above a hundred sayle seene comming hither; and therewith kissing my cheeke, hee
kindly left mee.
</p>
<p>Indeed, as for such newes from Allagant; the detriment of twenty eight houses, the
shoare-planted Cannon, the suspicion they had of the English, and the Towne foure
dayes in Armes were all true, save onely the confederacy of the English with the Moores,
that was false.
</p>
<p>Witnesse Sir Richard Halkins, and the Captaines of his Squader, who a little after
Christmas, comming to the Road, went to the Governour to cleere himselfe, and the
<span class="right-marginnote">[X. 469.]</span>Fleete of that absurd imputation layde to their charge. The twelfth day of Christmasse
expired, they beganne to threaten me on still with moe Tortures, even till Candlemasse:
In all which comfortlesse time, I was miserably afflicted with the beastly plague
of gnawing Vermin, which lay crawling in lumps, within, without, and about my body:
yea, hanging in clusters about my beard, my lips, my nostriles, and my eye-browes,
almost inclosing my sight.
</p>
<p>And for a greater satisfaction to their mercilesse mindes, the Governour caused Areta,
his silver plate keeper, to gather and swipe the Vermine upon me twice in eight <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb407" href="#pb407">407</a>]</span>dayes, which tormented me to the death, beeing a perpetuall punishment; for mine armes
being broake, my hands lucken and sticking fast to the palmes of both hands, <span class="marginnote"><i>No payne so grievous, as a lame man to be still tormented with gnawing vermine.</i></span>by reason of the shrunke sinewes; I was unable to lift mine armes, or stir my fingers,
much-lesse to avoyde the filthy Vermine: neyther could my legges and feete performe
it beeing impotent in all. Yet I acknowledge the poore Infidell, some few times, and
when opportunity served, would steale the keyes from Areta, and about mid-night would
enter my Roome, with stickes and burning oyle, and sweeping them together in heapes,
would burne the greatest part, to my great Releafe; or doubtlesse I had beene miserably
eaten up, and devoured by them.
</p>
<p>And now some eight dayes before Candlemasse, the slave informed me that an English
Seminary Priest, borne in London, and belonging to the Bishops Colledge of Malaga;
and a Scottish Cowper, named Alexander Ley, borne in Dunbar, and there married; were
in Translating all my Bookes and Observations out of English, in the <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 470.]</span>Spanish tongue, bringing every other day numbers of wrot Papers to the Governour,
and for their paines had thirty duccats allowed, and that they were saying, I was
an Arch-Hereticke to the Pope and the Virgin Mary.
</p>
<p>Having redounded him concealed thankes, I was assured of their bloody Inquisition,
preparing my selfe in God, with Faith, and Patience to Receive and gane-stand it:
for my spirituall Resolution, was surely founded, being sightlesse of company, and
humane faces, I had intirely the light of my Soule celebrate to God Almighty.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>A politick enquiry of a damnable inquisition.</i></span>And hereupon the second day after Candlemas, the Governour, the Inquisitor a Canonicall
Priest, entered my Dungeon, accompanied with two Jesuites, one of which was Predicator,
and Superiour of the Tiatinean Colledge of Malaga: Where being Chaire set, Candle-lighted,
and doore locked; the Inquisitor after diverse frivolous questions, demaunded me if
I was a Romane Catholicke, and acknowledged the Popes Supremacy. To whom I answered,
I was neyther the one, nor did the other. And <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb408" href="#pb408">408</a>]</span>what power (sayd I,) have you to challenge me of my Religion, since it is a chiefe
Article, of the former concluded peace, that none of our Kings subjects should be
troubled by your Inquisition; but as you have murdered me for alledged Treason; so
you meane to Martyre me for Religion.
</p>
<p>And you Governour, as you have Tortured and hunger-starved this helplesse body, consumed
with cold and vermine to the last of my life; the Almighty God who revealeth the secrets
of all things (although I bee never relieved) will certainely discover it, to my Countrey
and to the World. And is this the best of your good deeds? you repay to our mercifull
King, who then being onely <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 471.]</span>King of Scotland, in the time of your just over-throw of Eighty Eight, gave secourse
to thousands of your Shipwracked people for many moneths; and in the end, caused transport
them safely to their desired Ports. Leaving to the Worlds memory an eternall stampe
of Christian Bounty, Mercy, and royall Charity, and your acquittance to him, is an
imputation of Treachery to his Fleete, detayning and mis-regarding his Letters and
Seales, and now imposing to a tormented Innocent, your lawlesse Inquisition.
</p>
<p>To which the Governour answered, all that was true, but it was done more through feare
then love, and therefore deserved the lesser thankes; but (interim) wee will follow
the utter-most of our ends. And the Jesuite Predicator to confirme his words, sayd,
there was no faith to be kept with Heretickes, which directly or indirectly is the
sublime policy of Conquerours, which our mighty and invincible Nation evermore taketh
notice of and observeth.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>A damnable Inquisitor applying false attributs to our blessed Lady.</i></span>Then the Inquisitor arrising, expressed himselfe thus: Behold the powerfull majesty
of Gods mother, Commaunder of her Sonne, equall to the Father, Wife to the Holy Ghost,
Queene of Heaven, Protector of Angels, and sole Gubernatrix of the earth, &amp;c. How
thou being first taken as a Spye, accused for Treachery, and innocently Tortured (as
we acknowledge we were better informed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb409" href="#pb409">409</a>]</span>lately from Madrile of the English intention) yet it was her power, her Divine power,
which brought these judgements upon thee; in that thou hast wrot calumniously against
her blessed miracles of Loretta: and against his Holinesse, the great Agent, and Christs
Viccar on earth: Therefore thou hast justly fallen into our hands, by her speciall
appointment; thy Bookes and papers, are miraculously <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 472.]</span>Translated by her speciall providence with thy owne Countrey-men: wherefore thou maist
clearely see, the impenetrable Misteries of our glorious Lady in punishing her offenders:
and for a humble satisfaction, Repent thee of thy wickednesse, and be converted to
the Holy mother Church. And after many such like exhortations of all the foure, the
Inquisitor assigned me eight dayes for my Conversion: Saying, that hee, and the Tiatines
would twice a day visite mee in that time, intreating me to be advised againe the
next morning, of these doubts and difficulties that withstood my Conscience.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>A Sicophaniticall Oration from a jugling Jebusite.</i></span>Then in leaving mee, the Jesuite Predicator making a a Crosse upon my crossed breast,
sayd, My sonne, beholde you deserve to be burnt quicke, but by the grace of our Lady
of Loretta, whom you have blasphemed, wee will both save your Soule and Body: Spewing
forth also this Fæminine Latine; Nam mansueta et misericordiosa est Ecclesia, O Ecclesia
Romana! extra quem non est salus: They gone and I alone, all this night, was I instant
with my God, imploring his Grace, to Rectifie my thoughts, illuminate my understanding,
confirme my confidence, beatifie my memory, to sanctifie my knowledge, to expell the
servile feare of Death, and to save my soule, from the intangling corruption of any
private ends, illusions, or mundane Respects whatsoever.
</p>
<p>The next morning, the three Ecclesiastickes returned, and being placed with Chaires
and Candles, the Inquisitor made interrogation, of what difficulties, errors, or mis-beliefe
I had. To whom ingenuously I answered I had none, neyther any difficulty, errour,
nor mis-beliefe; but was confident in the promises of Jesus Christ, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb410" href="#pb410">410</a>]</span>assuredly believed his Revealed will in the Gospell, professed <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 473.]</span>in the Reformed Catholicke Church; which being confirmed by Grace, I had the infallible
assurance in my Soule, of the true Christian Faith.
</p>
<p>To these words, he answered, thou art no Christian, but an absurd Hereticke, and without
Conversion, a member of perdition. Whereupon I replied, Reverend Sir, the nature of
Charity and Religion, doe not consist in opprobious speeches; wherefore if you would
convert me (as you say) convince mee by Argument: if not, all your threatenings of
fire, Death, nor Torments, shall make me shrinke from the truth of Gods Word in Sacred
Scriptures. <span class="marginnote"><i>The fury of a mad inquisitor to have almost slain me.</i></span>Whereupon the mad Inquisitor clapd mee on the face with his foote, abusing me with
many Raylings, and if the jesuites had not intercepted him, he had stobbed me with
a knife; where, when dismissed, I never saw him more.
</p>
<p>The third day insuing (and having broake their promise) the two Jesuites returned,
and after a frowning silence, the Superiour asked me of my Resolution: I told him
I was Resolved already, unlesse hee could show me good Reasons in the contrary. Whereupon
having past with me some few superficial Arguments of their seaven Sacraments, Intercession,
Transubstantiation, Images, Purgatory, Miracles, Merit, &amp;c. he begun to brag of their
Church her Antiquity, Universality, and Uniformity. Auncient no (sayd I) for the Profession
of my Faith, hath beene ever since the first time of the Apostles; And Christ had
ever his owne Church (howsoever obscure) in the greatest time of your darknesse.
</p>
<p>So Rome foure hundred yeares and upward, was the true Church; but afterward falling
in apostacy by meanes of her corrupt leaders, wee have left her in nothing, but what
shee hath left her former selfe. Universall no; although shee assumeth a Catholicke
name, was not the <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 474.]</span>Church in the East, a greater Church than yours in the West for hundreds of yeares,
and I pray you what are now the Orientall Churches in Asia, (besides the Greeks) <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb411" href="#pb411">411</a>]</span>and the Æthiopian Affricans that doe not so much as know, or heare of your Pope, far
lesse his profession.
</p>
<p>With no small adoe, Boniface the third, obtained of Phocas the Emperour to be called
universall Bishop: which was asisted afterward by Puppin the French King, and ratified
by Paleologus, the father of Constantine who lost Constantinople: <span class="marginnote"><i>The Romish Church falls short of true antiquity, universality, and uniformity.</i></span>And what long contraversies about this new power, was betweene your Popes, and the
counsells of Carthage, Calcedon, Ephesus, Alexandria, and Nice. Uniformable no; some
of your Priests give the Sacrament onely in Bread, for reall flesh and blood, some
in Wine without Bread, and some in both.
</p>
<p>The Bavarians in their owne language sing the Psalmes in prose at their Masses, and
not else where done: The second Commandement goeth current amongst some of your Catholicks
in France, yet not in Bretagne, nor Provance; so doth it in Austria and Bavaria, but
not in Italy and Spaine.
</p>
<p>It is most evident, what your former Popes have confirmed, the succeeding Popes have
disanulled, and dayly doe, as their present lives, and your auncient Histories beare
a true record.
</p>
<p>And was there not at one time, three Popes in three severall places? and oftentimes
two at once: One professing one Heresie, and another Atheisme: What mutinies and malice,
are dayly among your Monasteries, each envying anothers priviledge, anothers preferment,
anothers wealth: And your order (father) by all the other Monasticks, is hated and
vilipended to death; besides diversities of Doctrine, betweene your professors and
the Dominicans: <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 475.]</span>and hundreds of like disunities you have both in ceremony and order which now I suspend:
So I pray you (father) where your uniformity, much lesse your universality, and worst
of all your antiquity.
</p>
<p>Having thus concluded, the fiery fac&#x2019;d Jesuits, with boisterous menacings left mee;
and the eight day thereafter, being the last day of their Inquisition, they returned
againe, in a more milder disposition: where after divers <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb412" href="#pb412">412</a>]</span>arguments on both sides, the two Jesuits with teares distilling from their eyes, solidly
protested, they were sorry from their heart, for that terrible death I was to undergo,
and above all the loosing of my soule: <span class="marginnote"><i>The Jesuits last allurements for my conversion to their sect.</i></span>And falling downe on their knees, cryed, convert, convert, O deare brother! for our
blessed Ladies sake convert: To whom I replyed, that neither death nor fire I feared;
for I was resolved for both, yet thinking my selfe unworthy to suffer for Christ and
the Gospells sake, considering my vildnesse and my owne unworthinesse: yet the Spirit
of God assureth my faith, it is his divine pleasure it should be so that I must suffer.
Wherefore if I should divert, trust mee not, for I would but dissemble with you (through
feare, flattery, or force) to shunne present death.
</p>
<p>Whereupon they called the Governour, and after their privy consulting, hee thus spoke;
Deare brother, my greatest desire is, to have thee a good Christian, a Romane Catholick,
to which if thy conscience will yeeld, I will shew thee as great courtesie, as thou
hast receaved cruelty: for pitty it were, that such an invincible spirit, and endued
with so many good parts, should perish in both worlds for ever. Plucke up thy heart,
and let the love of our blessed Lady enter in thy soule: Let not thy former sufferings
dismay thee, (for thy sores being yet greene and curable) I shall transport thee to
a fine Chamber, and there thou shalst have all needfull things for the recovery of
<span class="right-marginnote">[X. 476.]</span>thy health and strength. Thy money and Patents shall be refounded, but thy hereticall
Bookes are already burned: And lastly sayd he, I will send thee with my owne Servant
to Court, Counsel, and King, with letters from the holy Inquisition, and from mee,
faithfully promising thou shalt enjoy a Pension of three hundred Duccats a yeare.
</p>
<p>But having satisfied his bewitching policy with a Christian constancy; they all three
left mee in a thundering rage; vowing, I should that night have the first seale of
my long sorrowes: And directing their course to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb413" href="#pb413">413</a>]</span>Bishop and Inquisitor (for the Governour had wrested the Inquisition upon mee, to
free him of his former aspersion layd upon the English Fleet, and my tryall therefore,
converting it all to matters of Religion) the Inquisition (I say) sat forthwith, <span class="marginnote"><i>A condemnatory sentence to death by the Inquisition.</i></span>where first I was condemned to receave that night eleven strangling torments in my
Dungeon: and then after Easter Holy dayes, I should be transported privatly to Grenada,
and there about mid-night to be burnt body and bones into ashes, and my ashes to be
flung into the ayre: Well, that same night the Scrivan, Sergeants, and the young English
Priest entered my melancholly staunce: where the Priest in the English tongue urging
mee all that he could (though little it was hee could doe) and unprevailing, I was
disburdened of mine irones, unclothed to my skin, set on my knees and held up fast
with their hands: where instantly setting my teeth asunder with iron Cadges, they
filled my belly full of water, even gorgeing to my throat: Then with a garter they
bound fast my throat, till the white of mine eye turned upward; and being laid on
my side, I was by two Sergeants tumbled to and fro seven times through the roome;
even till I was almost strangled: This done, they <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 477.]</span>fastned a small cord about each one of my great toes, and hoysing me therewith to
the roofe of a high loft (for the cords runne on two rings of iron fastned above)
they cut the garter, and there I hung, with my head downward, in my tormented weight,
till all the gushing water dissolved: This done, I was let downe from the loft, quite
senslesse, lying a long time cold dead among their hands: whereof the Governour being
informed, came running up stayres, crying, Is he dead, O fie villanes goe fetch me
Wine, which they powred in my mouth, regayning thereby a slender sparke of breath.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>A Turkish slaves charity in the bowels of compassion.</i></span>These strangling torments ended, and I reclothed, and fast bolted againe they left
mee lying on the cold floore praysing my God, and singing of a Psalme. The next morning
the pittifull Turke visiting mee with bread and water, brought me also secretly in
his shirt sleeve, two <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb414" href="#pb414">414</a>]</span>handfull of Rasins and figges, laying them on the floore amongst the crawling vermine,
for having no use of armes nor hands, I was constrayned by hunger and impotency of
time, to licke one up with another with my tongue: This charity of figs the slave
did once every weeke or fortnight, or else I had long or then famished.
</p>
<p>After which sorrowfull distresse, and inhumane usage, the eye-melting Turke taking
displeasure, fell five dayes sicke, and bedfast: but the house Spaniards understanding
his disease made him beleeve I was a Divell, a Sorcerer, a Nigromancer, and a blasphemous
miscreant, against their Pope, their Lady, and their Church; giving him such a distast,
that for thirty dayes, he never durst looke me in the face, being affraid of witchcraft.
</p>
<p>All this time of his absence, one Ellinor the Cooke, an Indian Negro woman, attended
mee, for she being a <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 478.]</span>Christian drudge, had more liberty to visit mee, than the slavish Infidell: who certainly
(under God) prolonged then my languishing life, conveighing me for foure weekes space,
once a day some lesse or more nourishment, and in <span class="marginnote"><i>The deceitfulness of female inconstancies.</i></span>her pocket a bottle glasse of Wine. Being no wayes semblable to the soule betraying

con Palabras lesongeras: to wit, Women deceave men, some of them, grieving them with
their fayned teares, and other fawning on them with flattering words. But;

<p class="first">Now about the middle of Lent, Hazier, my former Friend, was appoynted to attend me
agayne, suspecting Ellenors compassion; but as my miseries were multiplied, my Patience
in God was redoubled: For men are rather killed with the impatience they have in adversity,
then adversity it selfe: And of all men, that man is most <span class="marginnote"><i>An impatient man in trouble is a triple torture.</i></span>unhappy, to whom God in his troubles hath not given Patience; for as the violent enemy
of age is griefe, so is the mindes impatiency, the arch-corruptor of all our troubles:
But indeede in the weakenesse of judgement, when men seeme lost by long affliction
to themselves, then they are often and ever neerest to God: for who would have thought,
that I who had seene so many sects and varieties of Religion, dispersed over the face
of the earth, could have stucke fast to any religion at all; Travailers being reputed
to be Ubique et omnibus parati. But I will tell thee Christian, it was the grace of
God in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb416" href="#pb416">416</a>]</span>me, and not mine: For as fire lying hid under ashes, and touch&#x2019;d will flame; so I
seeming to my selfe carelesse of Christianity, then God pricking my Conscience made
tryall of my Faith: For Christ forbid, that every Shippe which coasteth the rockey
shoare, should leave her ruines there.
</p>
<p>This I speake not for any selfe-prayse, but to glorifie God, and to condemne the rash
censures of opinion, and <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 480.]</span>with Phocion, I mistrust my selfe, because of popular applause: Erubuit quasi peccasset
quod placuerit: But now to abbreviate a thousand Circumstances of my Lamentable sufferings,
which this Volume may not suffer to containe: By Gods great providence, about a fortnight
before Easter, Anno 1621. there came a Spanish Cavaliere of Grenada to Malaga, whom
the Governour one night invited to Supper, being of old acquaintance: where after
Supper to intertayne Discourse, the Governour related and <span class="marginnote"><i>Gods great mercy in my first discovery by a stranger.</i></span>disclosed to the stranger (God working thereby my discovery and deliverance) all the
proceedings and causes of my first apprehending, my Confessions, Torments, starvings,
their mistaking of the English Fleete, and finally the wresting of the Inquisition
upon me, and their Condemnatory Sentence seeming also much to Lament my mis-fortunes,
and praysing my Travailes and Deserts.
</p>
<p>Now all this while, the Gentlemans servant, a Flandrish Fleming, standing at his Maisters
backe, and adhering to all the Governours Relations, was astonished, to heare of a
sakelesse Stranger, to have indured, and to indure such damnable Murther and Cruelty.
Whereupon, the Discourse ending and mid-night past, the stranger returned to his Lodging;
where the Fleming having bedded his Maister, and himselfe also in another Roome, he
could not sleepe all that night, and if hee slumbered, still hee thought hee saw a
man Torturing, and burning in the fire: which hee confessed to M. Wilds when morning
came.
</p>
<p>Well, he longed for day, and it being come, and hee cloathed, hee quietly left his
Lodging, inquiring for an <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb417" href="#pb417">417</a>]</span>English Factor, and comming to the House of M. Richard Wilds, the chiefe English Consull:
Hee told him <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 481.]</span>all what hee heard the Governour tell his Master, but could not tell my name: only
Maister Wilds conjectur&#x2019;d it was I, because of the others report of a Traveller, and
of his first and former acquaintance with me there.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>These are the English Factors which first wrought my reliefe.</i></span>Whereupon the Fleming being dismissed, he straight sent for the other English Factors,
Mr. Richard Busbitche, Mr. John Corney, Mr. Hanger, Mr. Stanton, Mr. Cooke, Mr. Rowley,
and Mr. Woodson: where advising with them, what was best to be done for my reliefe;
they sent letters away immediatly with all post dilligence, to Sir Walter Aston, his
Majesties Ambassadour lying at Madrile: Upon which hee mediating with the King and
Counsell of Spaine, obtained a strait warrant to command the Governour of Malaga,
to deliver mee over in the English hands: which being come, to their great disliking,
I was released on Easter-satturday before midnight, and carryed uppon Hazier the slaves
backe to Master Busbitches house, where I was carefully attended till day light.
</p>
<p>Meanewhile (by great fortune) there being a Squader of his Majesties Ships lying in
the Road, Sir Richard Halkins came earely a shoare, accompanied with a strong trayne,
and receaved mee from the Merchants: Whence I was carryed on mens armes in a payre
of blanquets, to <span class="marginnote"><i>I durst not stay a shoare for feare of the Inquisition.</i></span>the Vangard his Majesties ship. And three dayes thereafter, I was transported to a
ship bound for England, the Fleets victualler, named the goodwill of Harwich; by direction
of the Generall Sir Robert Maunsell: where being well placed, and charge given by
Sir Richard Halkins to the ships master William Westerdale, for his carefulnes toward
the preservation of my life, which then was brought so low &amp; miserable. The foresaid
Merchants <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 482.]</span>sent mee from shoare (besides the ships victuals) a sute of Spanish apparrell, twelve
Hennes, a barrell of Wine, a basket full of Egges, two Roves of Figges and Rasins,
two hundred Orenges and Lemmons, eight pounds of Sugar, a number of excellent good
Bread, and two <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb418" href="#pb418">418</a>]</span>hundred Realls in Silver and Gold; besides two double Pistolls Sir Richard Halkins
sent mee as a token of his love.
</p>
<p>The kindnesses of whom to bury in oblivion, were in me the very shame of ingratitude,
I being then a lost man and hopelesse of life, which argued in them a greater singularitie
of kindnesse and compassion. Yet I remember <span class="marginnote"><i>Religious Sir Richard Halkins my speciall friend.</i></span>for all my lamenes and distraction, I intreated Sir Richard Halkins to goe a shoare
to the Governour, and demand him for my gold, my eight Patents, my Booke of Armes,
and his Majesties Letters and Seales; the which he willingly obeyed, (being accompanied
with Captaine Cave, and Captaine Raymond) but could obtaine nothing at all, save blandements
and leying excuses.
</p>
<p>And now on the twelfth day of our lying in the Road, our ship weighing her Anchors,
and hoysing her Sailes, wee passed through the straits of Gibelterre, or fretum Herculeum;
for this was the furthest Land that Hercules could attayne unto; which made him erect
a Pillar, and indent thereon, nil ultra; but when Charles the fift, returned from
that untoward voyage of Algier, hee caused to set up in the same place, Plus ultra.
</p>
<p>Here in this Channell, I remarked a perpetuall current; flowing from the Ocean to
the Mediterrene Sea without any regresse: which indeed is admirable the Mediterranean
<span class="right-marginnote">[X. 483.]</span>Seas being hembd in, and environed with the mayne Continent of South Europe; the North
and North west coasts of Asia, and the Northerne parts of Affricke; save onely the
narrow passage of Hellespont, which from Mare Propontis bendeth his course to Mare
Euxinum: And yet the Euxine, or blacke Sea, hath no affinity with any other moving
waters, being likewise incompassed with the mayne continent: And from it also runneth
a continuall current, through Bosphorus Thraicus, to the Mediterraneum.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The strait of Gibelterre five leagues broad.</i></span>This narrow Sea on Affricke, or side of Fez, consisteth betweene Cap di Sprat, and
the Promontore of Sewty, and upon the coast of Spayne, betweene Cap de Trafolger,
and the butting forehead-land of Gibelterre, or Jubile <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb419" href="#pb419">419</a>]</span>Tauro; the passage being five leagues broad, and nine in length.
</p>
<p>And to be briefe, upon the fifty day after my departure from Malaga, I arrived at
Datford upon Thames; whence the next morning I was carried to Theoballs on a feather-bed,
and brought to the privy Gallery, for the Kings comming from Parke. Witnesse all the
Court of England, even from the King to the Kitchin, what a martyrd anatomy I was,
at then of me their first sight; and what small hope was either expected of my life
or recovery.
</p>
<p>Where, when immediatly having made my most humble and grievous complaints unto his
sacred Majesty, his gracious consideration (in the meane time) was such, for the recovery
of my health, that I was twice sent to the Bath at the charges of his Royall love,
during the space of twenty seven weekes, where by the Divine providence, and his Princely
clemency, I have recovered for the time in a <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 484.]</span>large measure, the health and strength of my body, although my left Arme, and crushed
bones be incurable.
</p>
<p>Meane while, in the first Weeke of my Arrivall in England, I was conveyed from Theobalds
(by his Majesties direction) to Don Diego Surmento de Gundamore, the Spanish Ambassadour,
then Resident in Holborne. <span class="marginnote"><i>A false promise unperformed.</i></span>Where he votally undertooke, before then the two Lord Marquesses, Hammilton and Buckingham,
(confirming it the day following to his Majesty at Greenewich) that after a condigne
tryall had from Spaine, concerning my grievances: I should have all my money, Cloathes,
Observations, Testimoniall Patents, and his Majesties Seales restored me agayne, with
a thousand pound sterling also, (beeing modified by his Royall pleasure) of the Governour
of Malagaes meanes, for the maintayning of my Lame and Racked body.
</p>
<p>These promises were made the sixt of June 1621. and were to be performed againe Michaelmasse
day insuing: But this day come, hee continued his drifts to the Prima vera; and it
also arrived, he deferred time, with new protestations, onely to Easter or Pascua:
And that Season <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb420" href="#pb420">420</a>]</span>come, he turned my Pascua to Prison: For a little before his departure (seeing his
policy too strong for mine oppressed patience) I told him flatly in his face, from
the griefe of my soule, what he was, and what he went about; which afterward proved
true: Whereupon in the Chamber of Presence, before the Emperours Ambassadour, and
diverse Knights and Gentle-men, his Majesties servants: <span class="marginnote"><i>A single combat betweene a Spanish Earle and a Scottish Traveller.</i></span>he rashly adventured the credite of Leager honour, in a single Combat against me a
retorted Plaintive: Where indeed his Fistula was contra-banded with a fist, and for
Victory, favour lent him authority; because of my Commitment, <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 485.]</span>for I lay nine Weekes incarcerate in the Marshall-Sea at Southwarke: Whence I returned
with more credite, then hee left England with honesty; beeing both Vanquish&#x2019;d and
Victor. And my Muse left to mourne for my Liberty, deplored thus.

<p class="first">After this, their sequell answere being mortified, and I set at liberty by a just
favour of the Privy Councell, my formalists durst never attempt any further dispute
with me, neither any passing countenance in our rancounters: But what shall I say
concerning my grievances, Sed qui Patitur vincit: Since there is no helpe or Redresse
to bee <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 489.]</span>had for wrongs past, no, neither (alasse) for any present in either meane, or mighty
falls: for when the Starres of great states, decline under the selfe-same constellation
of my sorrowes, and made the deplored for spectacles, of the inconstancy of fortune;
what shall I then in a privat life, and publicke pilgrimage expect, but the common
calamity of this age, and the irrevocable redresse of my miseries sustayned, for this
Crowne and Kingdome of England, which shall be presently cleared: yet would to God,
I might doe, as Xerxes the Persian King did, that when the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb424" href="#pb424">424</a>]</span>Greekes had taken Sardis, the Metropole of Lydia, he commanded one of his servants
to stand before him everyday at dinner, and cry aloud, saying; the Grecians have taken
Sardis: whereby he was never at quiet, till it was recovered.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Incompatible griefe without deserved reliefe.</i></span>So would I, oppressed I, by mighty powers; (though not a King, yet the faythfull subject
of a King) cry dayly from the heart-broken sorrow of my incompatible injuries; O barbarous,
and inhumane Malaga! when shall my soule be revenged on thy cruell murther, and when
shall mine eyes see thy mercilesse destruction? But tush, what dreame I? now a dayes
griefe can find no reliefe, far lesse compassion, and meaner revenge, and so farewell
satisfaction, when flattering feare dare challenge obsequiousnesse, to the alteration
of any thing.
</p>
<p>But afterward when death, Heavens fatall messenger, and enemy to nature, had darted
King James of matchlesse memory; who sometimes (besides my soveraigne) in some respects,
and for the former cause, was a father to me; then was I forcibly (I say) constrayned
to preferre a bill of grievance to the upper house of Parliament Anno 1626. which
I dayly followed 17. weekes: Well; my grievances <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 490.]</span>were heard and considered, and thereupon an order graunted me (bearing the Lords reference
and pleasure concerning my suite) unto Sir Thomas Coventrey, Lord keeper of Englands
great Seale; and through whose office my businesse should have passed: which order
was delivered unto him, by Mr. James Maxwell Knight of the blacke Rode, and one of
his Majesties Bed-chamber, in behalfe of the Lords of the upper house: The order thus
being reserved then with the Lord-keeper for a moneth, hee appointed me to fetch him
(because of a Warrant to his <span class="marginnote"><i>A direction for Certificats by the Lord Keeper.</i></span>State office) the Certificats of Sir Walter Aston, Sir Robert Maunsell, and Sir Thomas
Button, to cleare my sufferings, and the causes wherefore: which I gladly obeyed,
and brought all their three Certificates unto him: yea, and Sir Walter Aston, (besides
his hand-writ) spoke seriously face to face with him thereanent.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb425" href="#pb425">425</a>]</span>
</p>
<p>Meane-while the house breaking up abruptly (because of soveraigne disliking) their
order for my suite could take none effect as then, nor yet since, in regard it was
no Session Parliament; and so my order and reliefe lyeth suspended till some hapy
time.
</p>
<p>But now to confound the calumnious and vituperious Papists, the miscreant and miserable
Atheists, the peevish and selfe-opiniating Puritanes, the faithles misbeleeving Mungrells
of true Religion, and of this trueth: And the very objections have beene sayd sometimes
in my face, by irreligious and disdainefull Nullifidians: who have sayd and thought
that I could neither be so constant, nor they so cruell: I thinke it not amisse, to
set downe verbally one of their Certificats here, being all of one style, and to one
purpose; and thus it followeth.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first h2like"><span class="right-marginnote">[X. 491.]</span>To the Right Honorable, Sir Thomas Coventry Knight, Lord Keeper of the great Seale
of England, &amp;c.
</p>
<p>May it please your Honour: I have taken boldnesse to certifie your good Lordship,
of the trueth concerning the grievous sufferings of this heavily injured man, William
Lithgow: true it is, that this bearer, being bound for Alexandria in Egypt, having
with him Letters of safe Conduct, under the Hand and Seale of his late Majesty King
James of blessed memory; ran-countred with us, and our Fleete at Malaga: Whereof I
was imployed as Vice-Admirall against the Pyrats of Algier; where he repayring a Boord
of us, and frequenting our Company a shoare, was presently (after we had set Sayle)
apprehended by Command of the Governour and Magistrates there as a Spie; whom they
suspected, had of purpose beene left behind by our Generall, and us of the Counsell
of Warre, for the Discovery of that place, and other adjacent parts: Whereupon beeing
secretly imprisoned in the Governours Palace; and after serious examination of our
intention; hee was without any cause done, or offered by him, most <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb426" href="#pb426">426</a>]</span><span class="right-marginnote">[X. 492.]</span>unjustly put to the cruell Racke and tortures; besides all other his unspeakable miseries,
which for a long time he sustained thereafter: whereof I was credibly and infallibly
informed by M. Richard Wilds, to whom he was first discovered, and by other English
Factors of good note then resident there: in my repayring diverse times to the Roade
of that towne with my Squadron of shippes, during the time of his long imprisonment,
and after his deliverance. And afterward the Governour there beeing better informed
of our loyall proceedings in those parts, and to colour their former cruelties, and
suspition had of us, hee did wrest the Inquisition upon him, where being condemned
to Death, he had doubtlesse undergone (as I was likewise truely informed by the afore-said
Merchants) the finall Sentence of their Inquisition: if it had not beene, for the
Religious care, and speedy prevention of Sir Walter Aston, then Leiger Ambassadour
there: By whose earnest mediation he being delivered, and afterwards sent home by
direction of Sir Robert Maunsell Generall: I now commend his grievous and lamentable
cause, unto your Lordshippes tender and Religious Consideration. Resting,
</p>
<p class="signed">Your Lordships to Command,
<br>to serve You:
</p>
<p class="signed">From Fulham this tenth
<br>of July. 1626.
</p>
<p class="signed">Sir Thomas Button.</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p><span class="right-marginnote">[X. 493.]</span>And now to conclude this Tragicall discourse, the Religious eye, may perceive Gods
compassionate love, foure wayes here extended. First, his powerfull providence in
my long and admirable preservation in Prison: hunger, Vermine, and Tortures, being
my comfortlesse Companions. Secondly, the pittifull kindnesse of his All-seeing <span class="marginnote"><i>Gods miraculous mercy in my deliverances.</i></span>Eye, in the miraculous Wonder of my Discovery, when the perverted policy of subtile
Serpents, had sceleratly suggested my concealement. Thirdly, his unspeakable mercy
in my unlooked-for deliverance, beeing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb427" href="#pb427">427</a>]</span>by hopelesse me, not thought, nor sought; and yet by his munificence was wrought.
And lastly, his gracious goodnesse, in the recovery (after some large measure) of
my health and use of body againe; all prayse and glory be to his infinite Majesty
therefore.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>And finally, merit beeing masked, with the darkenesse of ingratitude, and the morning
Spring-tide of 1627. come: I set face from Court for Scotland, suiting my discontents,
with a pedestriall Progresse, and my feete with the palludiat way; where fixing mine
eyes on Edenbrugh, and prosecuting the Tennor of a Regall Commission (which partly
beeing some where obeyed, and other-where suspended) it gave mee a large sight of
the whole Kingdome, both Continent, and Iles. The particular Description whereof,
in all parts, and of all places, besides Ports and Rivers: I must referre to the owne
Volume already perfected, Intitulated Lithgowes Surveigh of Scotland: which this Worke
may not Containe, nor time suffer to publish till a fitter occasion. Only Commenting
a little upon some generalls. I hasten <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 494.]</span>to be at Finis. Traversing the Westerne Iles (whose inhabitants, like to as many Bulwarkes,
are abler and apter to preserve and defend, their libertie and Precincts from incursive

there: Such is the <span class="marginnote"><i>The kindnes I received from the illustrious Lord the Marques of Hammilton.</i></span>desperate courage of these awfull Hebridians:) I arrived (I say) at the Ile of Arrane,

by the illustrious Lord, James Marquesse of Hammilton, Earle of Arrane and Cambridge,

</div>
<p class="first">This Ile of Arrane, is thirty miles long, eight in breadth, and distant from the Maine,
twenty foure miles; beeing sur-clouded with Goatfield Hill: which with wide-eyes,
over-looketh our Westerne Continent, and the Northerne Countrey of Ireland: bringing
also to sight in a cleare Summers day, the Ile of Manne, and the higher <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 495.]</span>Coast of Cumberland: A larger prospect no Mountaine in the World can show, poynting
out three Kingdomes at one sight: Neither any like Ile or braver Gentry, for good
Archers, and hill-hovering Hunters. Having agayne re-shoared the Maine, I coasted
Galloway even to the Mould that butteth into the Sea, with a large Promontore, being
the South-most part of the Kingdome. And thence footing all that large Countrey to
Dumfries, and so to Carlile: I found heere in Galloway in diverse Rode-way Innes,
as good Cheare, Hospitality, and Serviceable attendance, as though I had beene ingrafted
in Lombardy or Naples.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The nobility and commodities of Galloway excell in goodnesse.</i></span>The Wooll of which Countrey, is nothing inferiour to that in Biscai of Spaine: providing
they had skill, to fine, Spin, Weave, and labour it as they should. Nay, the Calabrian
silke, had never a better luster, and softer gripe, then I have seene and touched
this growing wooll there on Sheepes backes: the Mutton whereof excelleth in sweetnesse.
So this Country aboundeth in Bestiall, especially in little Horses, which for mettall
and Riding, may rather be tearmed bastard Barbs, then Gallowedian Nagges.
</p>
<p>Likewise their Nobility and Gentry are as courteous, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb429" href="#pb429">429</a>]</span>every way generously disposed, as eyther discretion would wish, and honour Command:
that (Cunningham being excepted, which may bee called the Accademy of Religion, for
a sanctified Clergy, and a godly people) certainly <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 496.]</span>Galloway is become more civill of late, then any Maritine Country, bordering with
the Westerne Sea. But now to observe my former Summary condition, the length of the
Kingdome lyeth South and North: That is, betweene Dungsby head in Cathnes, and the
afore-sayde Mould of Galloway; beeing distant per rectam lineam, which my weary feet
troad over from poynt to poynt (the way of Lochreall, Carrick, Kyle, Aire, Glasgow,
Stirveling, St. Johns Towne, Stormount, the Blair of Atholl, the Bra of Mar, Badeynoh,
Innernes, Rosse, Sutherland, and so to the North Promontore of Cathnes) extending
to three hundred twenty miles: which I reckon to be foure hundred and fifty English
miles: Confounding hereby the ignorant presumption of blind Cosmographers, who <span class="marginnote"><i>Scotland is</i> 120. <i>miles longer than England.</i></span>in their Mappes make England longer than Scotland; when contrariwise Scotland out
strippeth the other in length, a hundred and twenty miles. The breadth whereof I grant
is narrower than England; yet extending betweene the extremities of both Coasts in
divers parts to threescore, fourscore, and a hundred of our miles: But because of
the Sea ingulfing the Land, and cutting it in so many Angles, making great Lakes,
Bayes, and dangerous Firths, on both sides of the Kingdome, the true breadth thereof
can not justly be conjectured, nor soundly set downe.
</p>
<p>Our chiefest fresh water Lakes are these, Lochlomond, contayning twenty foure Iles,
and in length as many miles: divers whereof are inriched with Woods, Deere, and other
Bestiall: The large and long Lake of Loch-Tay, in Atholl, the Mother and Godmother
of Headstrong Tay, the greatest River in the Kingdome: And Lochnes, in the higher
parts of Murray, the River whereof (that graceth the pleasant and commodious situation
of Innernes) no frost can freize: The propriety of which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb430" href="#pb430">430</a>]</span>water will quickly melt and dissolve any hard congealed lumps of frozen Ice, be it
on Man or Beast, stone or timber.
</p>
<p>The chiefest Rivers are Clyde, Tay, Tweed, Forth, Dee, Spay, Nith, Nesse, and Dingwells
flood-ingorging Lake, that confirmeth Porta salutis; being all of them, <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 497.]</span>where they returne their tributs to their father Ocean portable; and as it were resting
places for turmoyled seas and ships: And the principall Townes are Edenbrugh, Perth,
Glasgow, Dundie, Abirdene, St. Andrewes, Aire, Stirveling, Lithgow, Dumfries, Innernes,
Elgin, Minros, Jedbrugh, Hadington, Leith, &amp;c. and for antiquity, old Lanerk, &amp;c.
</p>
<p>So the most delicious soiles of the Kingdome are these following: first, the bounds
of Clyde, or Cliddisdale, betweene Lanerk and Dunbertan, distanced twenty sixe miles;
and thence downeward to Rossay that kisseth the devulgements of the River: the beginning
whereof is at Arick stone sixteene miles above Lanerk, whose course contendeth for
threescore miles: All which, being the best mixed Countrey for Cornes, Meeds, Pastorage,
Woods, Parks, Orchards, Castles, Pallaces, divers kinds of Coale, and earth-fewell,
that our included Albion <span class="marginnote"><i>Cliddisdale is the Paradice of Scotland.</i></span>produceth: And may justly be surnamed the Paradice of Scotland: Besides, it is adorned
on both borders along, with the greatest Peeres, and Nobility in the Kingdome: The
Duke of Lennox, the Marques of Hammilton, the Earle of Angus, the Earle of Argyle,
and the Earles of Glencairne, Wigton, and Abircorne.
</p>
<p>And for Lord Barons, Semple, Rosse, Blantyre, and Dalliell: The chiefest Gentry whereof
are the Knights and Lairds of Luce, Skellmurelie, Blakhall, Greenock, Newwark, Houston,
Pook-maxwell, Sir George Elpingston of Blythswood, Minto, Cambusnethen, Calderwood,
the two Knights of Lieye, and Castel-hill, Sir James Lokharts elder &amp; yonger, Lamington,
Westraw, his Majesties Gentleman Sewer, Blakwood, Cobinton, Stanebyres, and Corhous,
&amp;c. All which in each degree, as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb431" href="#pb431">431</a>]</span>they illuminat the soyle with grandure, so the soyle reflecteth on them againe with
beauty, bounty, and riches.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line"><span class="right-marginnote">[X. 498.]</span>But least I partiall prove, because my breath
</p>
<p class="line">First sprung from Lanerk, so my christian faith;
</p>
<p class="line">Where thence (O natall place) my soule did coyle,
</p>
<p class="line">Blood, sprit, and sense, flesh, birth, life, love, and soyle;
</p>
<p class="line">I&#x2019;le leave Clydes fragrant fields, resplendant banks,
</p>
<p class="line">Bedeckt with Silvans, stately beauteous ranks
</p>
<p class="line">Of Pandedalian sparks; which lend the sight
</p>
<p class="line">Of variable colours, best Natures light;
</p>
<p class="line">And close these silver shades, that dazeling bloome
</p>
<p class="line">Mongst thickest Groaves, with many brae-fac&#x2019;d broome;
</p>
<p class="line">Strict in the records of eternall fame,
</p>
<p class="line">For sight, for gaine, for birth, for noble name.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">And now the second soyle for pleasure, is the platformd <span class="marginnote"><i>Carse and Murray two pleasant Soyles.</i></span>Carse of Gowry, twelve miles long (Wheat, Rye, Cornes, Fruit yards, being its onely
commodity) which I may tearme for its levelld face, to be the Garden of Angus; yea,
the Diamond-plot of Tay, or rather the youngest Sister of matchlesse Piemont: The
Inhabitants being onely defective in affablenesse, and communicating courtesies of
naturall things, whence sprung this Proverbe, The kearlles of the Carse.
</p>
<p>The third, and beautifull soyle, is the delectable planure of Murray, thirty miles
long, and sixe in breadth: whose comely grounds, inriched with Cornes, Plantings,
Pastorage, stately dwellings, overfaced with a generous Octavian Gentrye, and topped
with a Noble Earle, its chiefest Patrone; it may be surstyled, a second Lombardy,
or pleasant Meaddow of the North.
</p>
<p>Neither may I (abandoning eye-pleasing grounds) seclude here that sudaick bottome,
reaching thirty miles twixt Perth and Minros; involving the halfe of Angus, <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 499.]</span>within a fruitfull, populous, and nobilitat planure, the heart whereof saluting Glames,
kisseth Cowper: So likewise, as thrice divided Louthiane, is a girnell of graine,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb432" href="#pb432">432</a>]</span>for forrane Nations; and Fiffe twixt Carraill and Largo, the Ceren trenches of a Royall
Camp, the incircling coast a nest of Corporations; and Meandring Forth from tip-toed
Snadoun, the prospicuous mirrour for matchlesse Majesty: Even so is melting Tweed,
and weeping Tiviot, the Ægyptian Strands, that irriguat the fertile fields, which
imbolster both bosomes, sending their bordering breath of dayly necessaries to strengthen
the life of Barwick.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The Nobility and Gentry of Scotland, are the best house-keepers, and generous Gentlemen
in the World.</i></span>Now as for the Nobility and Gentry of the Kingdome; certainely, as they are generous,
manly, and full of courage; so are they courteous, discreet, learned Schollers, well
read in best Histories, delicatly linguishd, the most part of them, being brought
up in France or Italy: That for a generall compleat worthinesse, I never found their
matches amongst the best people of forrane Nations: being also good house-keepers,
affable to strangers, and full of Hospitality.
</p>
<p>And in a word the Seas of Scotland, and the Iles abound plentifully in all kind of
Fishes, the Rivers are ingorged with Salmond, the high-landish mountaines overcled
with Firre-trees, infinite Deere, and all sorts of other Bestiall, the Valleyes full
of Pasture, and Wild fowle; the low layd Playnes inriched with beds of grayne; Justice
all where administred, Lawes obeyed, malefactors punished, Oppressors curbed, the
Clergy religious, the people sincere Professors, and the Country peaceable to all
men.
</p>
<p>The chiefest commodities whereof, transported beyond sea, are these, Wheat, Cornes,
Hides, Skins, Tallow, Yearn, Linnen, Salt, Coale, Herrings, Salmond, Wooll, <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 500.]</span>Keilling, Ling, Turbet and Seaths. And last, and worst, all the Gold of the Kingdome,
is daily Transported away with superfluous posting for Court. Whence they never returne
any thing, save spend all, End all, then farewell Fortune: So that numbers of our
Nobility and Gentry now, become with idle projects, downe-drawers of destruction,
upon their owne neckes, their children, and their estates: and posting Postilions
by dissolute courses, to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb433" href="#pb433">433</a>]</span><span class="marginnote"><i>Prodigall and superfluous posting from Scotland to Court.</i></span>inrich Strangers, leave themselves deservingly desolate, of Lands, Meanes, and Honesty
for ever. Doing even with their former Vertue, long continuance, and memory of their
noble Ancestors, as M. Knoxe did with our glorious Churches of Abbocies, and Monasteries
(which were the greatest beauty of the Kingdome,) knocking all down to desolation;
leaving nought to be seene of admirable Edifices, but like to the Ruines of Troy,
Tyrus, and Thebes, lumpes of Wals, and heapes of stones.
</p>
<p>So do our ignoble Gallants (though nobly borne) swallow up the honour of their famous
Predecessours, with posting foolery, boy-winding Hornes, cormandizing Gluttony, Lust,
and vaine Apparrell; making a Transmigration of perpetuity to their present Belly,
and Backe. O lashivious ends: which I have condignely sisted, in my last Worke Intitulated
Scotlands welcome to King Charles: with all the abuses and grievances of the whole
Kingdome besides.
</p>
<p>But now leaving Prodigalls to their Purgatoriall Postings, I come to Trace through
Rosse, Sutherland, and Cathnes: Soiles so abundant in all things, fit to illustrate
greatnesse, Resplendour Gentry, and succour Commons; that their fertile goodnesse
far exceeded my expectation, and the affability of the better sort my deservings:
beeing <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 501.]</span>all of them the best, and most bountifull Christmasse-keepers (the Greekes excepted)
that ever I saw in the Christian World: Whose continuall incorporate Feastings one

me, to behold, such great and daily cheare, familiar fellow-ship, and joviall chearefulnesse;
that me thought the whole Winter there, seemed to me, but the Jubilee of one day.

</div>
<p class="first">Forsaking Cathnes, I imbraced the trembling Surges (at Dungsby) of strugling Neptune,
which ingorgeth Pentland or Pitland Firth with nine contrarious Tides: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb437" href="#pb437">437</a>]</span>each Tide over-thwarting another with repugnant courses, have such violent streames,
and <span class="corr" id="xd29e10225" title="Source: combustions">combustious</span> waves, that if these dangerous Births be not rightly taken in passing <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 505.]</span>over, the Passengers shall quickely loose sight of life and land for ever: yea, and
one of these tides so forcible, at the backe of Stromaii, that it will carry any Vessell
backward, in despight of the winds, the length of its rapinous current.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>A dangerous place in Pentland Firth.</i></span>This dreadfull Firth is in breadth betweene the Continent of Cathnes, and the Ile
of South Rannald-shaw in Orknay twelve miles: And I denote this credibly, in a part
of the North-west end of this Gulfe, there is a certaine place of sea, where these
destracted tydes make their rancountering Randevouze, that whirleth ever about: cutting
in the middle circle a devalling hole, with which if either Ship or Boat shall happen
to encroach, they must quickly either throw over some thing into it, as a Barrell,
a piece of timber, and such like, or that fatall Euripus shall then suddenly become
their swallowing Sepulcher. A custome which these bordering Cathenians and Orcadians
have ever heretofore observed.
</p>
<p>Arriv&#x2019;d at South Rannaldshaw an Ile of five miles long, and thwarting the Ile of Burray,
I sighted Kirkwall, the Metropole of Pomonia, the mayne Land of Orknay, and the onely
Mistresse of all the circumjacent Iles being thirty in number. The chiefest whereof
(besides this tract of ground, in length twenty sixe, and broad five, sixe and seven
miles) are the Iles of Sanda, Westra, and Stronza: Kirkwall it selfe is adorned with
the stately and magnifick Church of St. Magnus built by the Danes, whose Signiory
with the Iles lately it was; but indeed for the time present, more beautified with
the godly life of a most venerable and religious Bishop Mr. George Grahame: whom now
I may tearme (Soveraignity excepted) to be the Father of the Countries government,
then an Ecclesiasticke Prelat: The Inhabitants being left void of a Governour, or
solid Patrone, are just become like to a <span class="right-marginnote">[X. 506.]</span>broken battell, a scattered people without a head: having <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb438" href="#pb438">438</a>]</span>but a Burges Shreive to administer Justice, and he too an Aliene to them, and a Resider
in Edenburgh: So that in most differences, and questions of importance, the Plaintives
are inforced to implore the Bishop for their Judge, and hee, the adverse Party for
redresse.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Zetland mightily impoverished by corrupt governement.</i></span>But the more remote parts of this auncient little Kingdome, as Zetland, and the adjacent
Iles there; have found such a sting of deoccular government within these few yeares;
that these once happy Iles, which long agoe my feet traded over, are Metamorphosed
in the Anatomy of succourlesse oppression, and the felicity of the Inhabitants, reinvolved
within the closet of a Cittadinean cluster.
</p>
<p>But now referring the whole particulars, and dividuall descriptions of these Septentrion
Iles, the mayne Continent, and the Gigantick Hebridian Iles, to my aforesayd worke
to be published, intitulated Lithgows surveigh of Scotland, I send this generall verdict
to the World:

some Stoicall Reader misconster and misconceave some parts of this eye-set History,
though not able to marre the trueth of it: yet howsoever, here is the just relation
of nineteene yeares <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb439" href="#pb439">439</a>]</span>travells, perfited in three deare-bought voyages: The generall computation of which
dimmensious spaces, in my goings, traversings, and returnings, through Kingdomes,
Continents, and Ilands, which my paynefull feet traced over (besides my passages of
Seas and Rivers) amounteth to thirty six thousand and odde miles, which draweth neare
to twice the circumference of the whole Earth. And so farewell.
